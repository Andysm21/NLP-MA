Bob Dylan,4Th Time Around,/b/bob+dylan/4th+time+around_20021421.html,"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,""  
I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

Bob Dylan,A Satisfied Mind,/b/bob+dylan/a+satisfied+mind_20021501.html,"How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Well, if I had to do it all over again,  
Babe, I'd do it all over you.  
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years,  
Babe, I'd even do that too.  
Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley,  
A cat, she's got nine lives,  
A millionaire's got a million dollars,  
King Saud's got four hundred wives.  
Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'  
That they're lookin' forward to.  
I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again  
And babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,  
Babe, I'd run circles all around.  
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.  
When my time arrives you better run for your life  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny,  
Baby, and my days are gonna come.  
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant  
When you hear me yellin', ""Fee-fi-fo-fum.""  
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,  
You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.  
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady  
A-doin' what I want to do,  
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late  
And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf.  
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there  
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.  
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,  
After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.  
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.

Bob Dylan,Ballad Of Donald White,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+of+donald+white_20155910.html,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

Bob Dylan,Belle Isle,/b/bob+dylan/belle+isle_20021513.html,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view  
The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".  
  
""Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.  
  
I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"".

Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours

Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass

And the sails are spread

Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

Bob Dylan,Beyond The Horizon,/b/bob+dylan/beyond+the+horizon_20538898.html,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's Dream,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+dream_20021589.html,"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+new+orleans+rag_20151228.html,"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.

Bob Dylan,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,/b/bob+dylan/can+you+please+crawl+out+your+window_20021634.html,"He sits in your room, his tomb with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursin' the dead that can't answer him back  
You know he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Batter have to go back and sit down.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,

Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm

So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An' one day he just ran away.

Wear an alligator boot.

Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,/b/bob+dylan/chimes+of+freedom_20021149.html,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Bob Dylan,Clean-Cut Kid,/b/bob+dylan/clean+cut+kid_20021359.html,"Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust  
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is  
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made him a killer  
That's what they did.  
  
He was on the basketball team, he was in the marching band  
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""  
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.  
  
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills  
A jeep to drive, blood to spill.  
  
They said, ""Congratulation, you got what it takes""  
They sent him back into the race without any brakes.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt  
Only game he could play was Russian Roulette.  
  
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread  
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.  
  
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole  
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar  
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.  
  
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust.  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about.  
  
He had a steady job, he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him That's what they did.

Bob Dylan,Clothes Line,/b/bob+dylan/clothes+line_20021565.html,"After a while we took in the clothes,  
Nobody said very much.  
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants  
Which nobody really wanted to touch.  
Mama come in and picked up a book  
An' Papa asked her what it was.  
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""  
Papa said, ""Well, just because.""  
Then they started to take back their clothes,  
Hang 'em on the line.  
It was January the thirtieth  
And everybody was feelin' fine.  
  
The next day everybody got up  
Seein' if the clothes were dry.  
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,  
Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi!""  
""Have you heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,  
""The Vice-President's gone mad!""  
""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night.""  
""Hmm, say, that's too bad!""  
""Well, there's nothin' we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,  
""It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.""  
""Yes, I guess so,"" said Ma,  
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.  
  
I reached up, touched my shirt,  
And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?""  
I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em.""  
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""  
I said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""  
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose  
Just as papa yelled outside,  
""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""  
Well, I just do what I'm told,  
So, I did it, of course.  
I went back in the house and Mama met me  
And then I shut all the doors.

I don't carry dead weight - I'm no flash in the pan  
All right, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?  
I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile

Feel like a fighting rooster - feel better than I ever felt  
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to
melt  
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls  
It must have been Don Pasquale makin' a two a.m. booty call  
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control  
Some people they ain't human, they got no heart or soul  
Well, I'm crying to The Lord - I'm tryin' to be meek and mild  
Yes, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, there's preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs  
I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs  
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey - I'll die before I turn senile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way  
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day  
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial

I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

Don't wanna amuse nobody, don't wanna be amused.  
  
But if you do right to me, baby,  
I'll do right to you, too.

With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold

Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight

Don't fall apart on me tonight

And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

Bob Dylan,Dusty Old Fairgrounds,/b/bob+dylan/dusty+old+fairgrounds_20190845.html,"by Bob Dylan  
  
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

Bob Dylan,Floater,/b/bob+dylan/floater_10043295.html,"Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know

It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know

First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.

And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.

Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.

But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.

He's got that fortress on the mountain  
With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in  
  
Handy dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feelin' kind of lazy  
He says, ""Ya want a gun? I'll give you one."" She says, ""Boy, you talking
crazy""  
Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy  
Handy dandy, pour him another brandy  
  
Handy dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full or sorrow  
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table he says,  
""Okay, boys, I'll see you tomorrow""  
Handy dandy, handy dandy, just like sugar and candy

Bob Dylan,House Carpenter,/b/bob+dylan/house+carpenter_20021273.html,"Well met, well met, my own true love  
Well met, well met, cried she  
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea  
And it's all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a King's daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there  
It's all for the love of thee  
  
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there  
I'm sure you're the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And I'm sure he's a fine young man  
  
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
I'll take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses, one, two, three  
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone  
And keep him good company.""  
  
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck  
Sayin' she wants company  
  
""Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?  
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?""  
""Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter  
I'm weepin' for my babies three.""  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven, my love  
You and I'll never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea

Lord I've tried and I've tried  
and all night long I've cried  
But I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
Didn't think you would leave me behind  
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind  
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I can't get you off of my mind.

You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool ev'ry new love you find  
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies  
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.

Looking far off into the east

We got so much in common  
We strive for the same old ends  
And I just can't wait  
Wait for us to become friends

And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby, pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I don't have one single rose  
I feel a change comin' on

But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm questionin' you.  
To take part in any quiz.  
It's just that I ain't got no watch  
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.

It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,

I am just a poor boy, baby,  
Lookin' to connect.  
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'  
That I ain't got any respect.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
You know I'd have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience, too,  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm wantin'  
Anything you never gave before.  
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,  
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,

Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.

Or a bell that never rings

Just took her youth and happiness  
As with the boy she vanished in  
The secret sweetness of their sin  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Lying there by the road  
  
He told her, ""love demanded space""  
So they roamed from place to place  
Although she realized she'd sinned  
She grew caution to the wind  
As she followed him around  
While he slowly dragged her down  
  
So overpowering was her love  
The it had made a captive of  
The young girl's heart and soul and mind  
In other words: love drove her blind  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Laying there by the road  
  
Too much emotion for a girl  
She let her heart become her world  
What world that God has never rocked  
For a sunder we are taught  
Had she been wise and she'd have known  
She could feed him love alone  
  
She should of known the day would come  
When he would quit her just for crumbs  
He needed fresh young meat to love  
And left her heart and mind to starve

Every step I take retreats  
Every journey always brings me back to you

Two angels who've been rescued from the fall

It lives from year to year  
It changes as it goes  
Oh, and on the way it grows  
But it never disappears

And a string of pearls  
The men said they preffered me  
To the other girls  
They took me to the best places  
But I could read it on their faces

While she plays  
The man I love has never heard of ""Ruby's Place""  
When he holds her with affection  
And he uses that old expression

The wedding spree the cruelty  
And still they go on mating  
  
And to the one the only one

Is greater again  
The prayers take off ascending  
All filled of love to the one above  
Asking for asking for asking for asking for  
A happy ending a happy ending a happy ending

But it's all part of a game  
Until I quench this thirst  
I will not close these eyes  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
You and I, we're the same  
We both carry this flame  
To depths of our souls  
Once this fever awakes  
We can never escape  
It's beyond our control  
We're all born with the hunger  
We're all born with the hunger  
Temptation bites your lip  
One kiss ignites the fire  
So begins the seduction  
As we succumb to desire  
Your body aches for more  
Why are you so surprised  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger - it never dies

Now I got this feeling  
You'll be the next in line

Like to make a song last forever  
But the next dance won't be mine

That's loving on borrowed time  
  
My old love's broken pieces  
And I ain't met the new  
You're here in the middle  
Hanging on until I do  
Cause I'm a train that stops  
At every station down the line  
You're a fool so desperate  
That you'll ride on borrowed time

And if you play your cards right after dancin? all night  
You won't have to walk home alone  
You won't have to walk home alone  
Boys you can hang loose and slip up real cool  
But if that lady has a love noose  
She might never let you go  
And if you think that maybe you're too young  
And you just can not cope  
The grab a razor sharp pair of cutting shears  
And cut a hole right in the rope  
Snip a hole right in the rope

You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line  
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time  
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning  
You can't remember what you did  
Just ring up some of your friends  
And they'll tell you just how low you slid  
Oh don't be ashamed of anything you hear  
After all you can't be blame  
When you're drinking so much beer  
Hey don't you worry  
That what you did just wasn't right  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night

Knowing that I know you care  
And how nothing I see

I followed him around in traveling shows  
Along the main county lines  
Watching him drinking his mind away  
Not ever knowing my name at time  
Each night when the show closed down  
He used to tell me of his dreams  
He was wearing new French suits  
While I mended my torn jeans

Then one night in Santa Fe  
The horses stop going around  
There he was my poor rich man  
Lying on the Mexico ground  
All the sad music of his life  
Is still spinning in my mind  
The carousel starts up again  
And I found my place in life

The marks of men her fortune she had won  
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,

I followed her to some darkened room,  
She took my money, she said ""I'll be with you soon""  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three  
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me  
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,  
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black  
She said the man you love is secretly true  
To someone else who is very close to you  
My advice is that you leave this place,  
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face

Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done

So I ran home and crawled in my bed,  
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said  
Then I remembered her strange perfume,  
And how I smelled it was in my own room!  
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,  
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand  
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,  
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve

You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow  
Out on the new horizon  
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings  
And if the sleep has left your ears  
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow  
  
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you

Across my dreams with nets of wonder  
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind  
I might have even called your name  
As I ran searching after something to believe in  
You might have seen me runnin'  
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind  
If you remember something there  
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'  
  
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you  
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of  
Across my dreams with nets of wonder  
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Climbing risk it all if you ain't living you're surviving  
Tell me why you dip you're toes when you could dive in  
Don't be scared to hurt yourself  
Take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when you're running and there's no light  
Love is a song when you've got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars  
All of my favorite scars  
I love my favorite scars  
  
High wire don't look down because below you is a raging fire  
But love is waiting for you on the other side  
We're not easy on ourselves  
So take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide

Must be a whisper in the wind

I could swear I saw you next to me  
Saying , oh I'm coming home  
You'll never spend another night alone

There was never a better time  
But you know those fires of Eden  
Still burn in this heart of mine

It's a nervous day  
And I look for a reason  
Why I should feel this way  
  
I hear a voice run before  
Drifting through my open door  
Saying it's alright  
We're going to light those flames tonight

And don't you wonder  
How we drifted so far  
When we belong to each other  
We were miles apart  
  
And there's a place  
That was meant for the two of us  
And when you touch the embers  
You feel my love  
As strong as it ever was

We've ever had a cry  
To keep away the reasoning of why we lie  
It only leads me down a lonely road  
And strange of fates as a world to  
A new and different time or place  
To live away the time of day so we can race  
Exactly what we choose just not to believe  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you  
I knew too well not to stay  
We paid our price turn our heads  
Close our eyes and sacrifice  
Excuses of love  
That once was warm has turned to ice  
But only leave me cold and so alone  
Now memories of years and fun  
Can only turn my eyes to see  
All the good that's been undone  
But I believe we're lucky just to learn  
From what we were  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you

It was easy for me to say goodbye  
Watch him walk right out the door  
Tellin' myself I'd forget his face  
Like all the other times before  
And I was halfway through the afternoon  
When I knew that I was wrong  
  
He was spinning around inside my head

So maybe some night while the music plays  
Though I don't know where or when  
I'll be walking into some crowded room

On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.  
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.  
Homeward bound,

Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting  
Silently for me.  
  
Ev'ry day's an endless stream  
Of cigarettes and magazines.  
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories  
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting  
Silently for me.  
  
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,  
I'll play the game and pretend.  
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity  
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting

'Cause I remember before  
When we danced on this floor  
His eyes were only on me  
  
Where did I go wrong  
They were playin' our song  
While I was cryin' all night long  
  
Two weeks later I heard a knock on my door  
He was back  
Just like all those good times before  
Ah, then he kissed me  
And he told me I left her 'cause I love you  
So much more than I knew  
  
I saw a man and he danced with his wife  
But now he's dancin' with me  
I remember before  
When we danced on this floor  
His eyes were only on me  
  
I saw a man and he danced with his wife

Only to be with you, only to be with you  
I have run, I have crawled  
Well, I have scaled these city walls  
These city walls only to be with you  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
Well, I have kissed honey lips  
Felt the healing, fingertips  
It burned like fire, this burning desire  
I have spoke tongue of angels  
And I have held hand of the devil  
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
I believe in the kingdom come  
When all the colors bleed into one  
Bleed into one and yes, I'm still running  
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains  
Carried the cross of my shame  
Of my shame and you know, I believed it  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

He said he would always stay  
But I was cruel  
I treated him like a fool

In the palm of my hand  
And rivers that ran through everyday  
I must have been mad  
I never knew what I had  
Until I threw it all away  
Until I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
It makes the world go around  
Love and only love  
It can't be deny  
No matter what you think about it  
You can't do without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So if you find someone  
Gives you all his love  
Take it to your heart  
Don't let it stray  
Ah one thing's for certain  
You're surely gonna be hurtin'  
If you throw it all away  
If you throw it all away

Cher,I Walk Alone,/c/cher/i+walk+alone_21067605.html,"There's a poet in me that remembers  
And there's an honesty in every word  
There's a dancer that feels her own beat  
And there's a daughter who loves  
  
There's a sinner in my bones  
And there's a joker in my head  
There are secrets in my soul  
And there are sorries that I have never said  
  
But there's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come  
  
Oh, I still got time to cope  
Time to hope  
Time to play  
Time to grow  
But for now I gotta walk alone  
I gotta walk alone  
  
There's a tight rope that I've been walking  
There's a daisy in my hair  
There's a heartbreak that has taught me  
Of what is raging  
And there's only love and fear  
  
There's a sadness in my confessions  
There's a healer howling at the moon  
And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming  
And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth  
  
But there's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come  
  
Oh, I still got time to cope  
Time to hope  
Time to play  
Time to grow  
But for now I gotta walk alone  
I gotta walk alone  
I gotta walk alone  
I've got to walk alone  
But for now I gotta walk alone  
  
Oh, I hear the thunder but I won't back down  
A soldier marches through the wrong side of town  
I'm gonna love you until I bleed  
And that's the story of me  
I gotta walk alone  
  
If they say time is everything  
There's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come  
  
Oh, I still got time to cope  
Time to hope  
Time to play  
Time to grow

Because you took him for a ride  
Because the time was on his side  
And because

And it holds a lot of rain

I know a thing or two

I really learned a lot  
I really learned a lot  
Love is like a stove  
It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts  
  
Some fools rave, of happiness  
Of blissfulness, togetherness  
Oh, some fools,  
They fool themselves, I guess  
They're not fooling me  
And I know it isn't true  
God, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts, (ooooo) love hurts  
(Ooooo), love hurts  
  
And I know it isn't true  
Oh, I know it isn't true

Early in the morning you hurt,  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts

Mama when my dollies have babies  
And I am a big lady  
Mama will a prince come and take me away  
  
When I said these things I believed in kings  
Then I didn't know love could hurt me so  
Slowly she replied, tears had filled her eyes  
Baby not so fast let your young life last  
  
Chorus  
  
I sang to her in fun, my teens had just began  
My age was not the same still we played the game  
Her eyes were filled with pride and slowly she replied  
Soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride  
  
Chorus  
  
Mama, will the hurt go away deep inside  
When I sang this song  
My poor world had gone along  
All my early dreams has turned to crystal streams  
My love it was last and more tears have past  
And left me just one thing a tender voice I sing

'Cause I've been licked, washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride.  
  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone

Cuz my man left me and he didn't say why  
So I guess I'll have to cry.

Monday knows what it's all about  
She's the kind of girl that can do without  
She was mature at sixteen years  
She grew up fast she was raised on tears  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
Her ma was wind and her pa was rain  
She made her home in an empty train  
Her clothes were patched  
And shoes were worn  
She played with the sun  
And fought with the storm  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She bought a book and learned to read  
So no one could learnt what she heard  
She even ate a hershey bar  
To make her kisses sweeter  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She wonder by night  
When the sun was disarray  
Cause every one notice her in the day  
She wrote in her book  
That a flower is good  
But why is a weed so misunderstood  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She learned how to sing  
And she learned how to pray  
She learned it all in one short day  
But she never learned black from white  
She never even learn how to fight  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do

I dropped by to pick up a reason  
For the thought that I caught that my head  
Was the event of the season  
Why in crowds  
Just a trace of my face  
Could seem so pleasin'  
I'll cop out to the change  
But a stranger is putting the tease on  
  
I was down on the ground  
When the messenger  
Wrote me a letter  
I was raised by the praise of a fan  
Who said I upset her  
Any girl in the world  
Could have easily known me much better  
She said  
You're strange, but don't change  
And I let her  
In a while when the smile on my face  
Turned to plaster  
Stick around while the clown who gets sick  
Does the trick of disaster  
For the race of my head and my face  
Is moving much faster  
  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know  
Why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
I don't know, why don't you ask her

Donna Summer,Born To Die,/d/donna+summer/born+to+die_20042279.html,"Just a baby  
On a doorstep  
It's how they found me  
Cold and hungry  
Raised on hatred  
Fed by strangers  
As a young girl  
I often wondered  
  
[Chorus]  
Am I born to die  
Never having lived  
Am I born to die  
Without love  
In my life  
  
People push me  
Knock me down  
My foster parents  
Kicked me around  
They brought me up on  
Loneliness  
I never had me  
A single friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Must be someone  
In this world  
Who can save me  
From myself  
  
Or am I born to die  
Never having lived  
Am I born to die  
Without love  
In my life

It's hard for her to do

It's been eating at her heart  
Wish I could find the words to tell you  
But I don't know where to start  
And when she looks into the future  
She sees too many problems  
There are so many reasons  
She should pack up the past  
And breakaway

I was dancing with all the queens and lords  
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand  
And began dancing my eyes away  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
I was feeling so dizzy and lame  
Was it champagne or really him to blame  
Though our faces were disguised  
Feelings couldn't hide  
That this wasn't just some kind of game

Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know

Domino I'd like to know  
Domino who's the real domino  
Though we're strangers still  
It's real love I feel domino  
  
Then at midnight the bells were all rung  
And he kisses me and held me in his arms  
Then a crowd would ride between us  
Trapped away my stranger  
And I never did find him again

You'll think it's strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love  
After all that I've done  
  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to nines  
For sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen  
I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window  
Staying out of the sun  
So I choose freedom  
Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it too  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune  
And as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it appeared to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you, and hope you love me  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days

Oh what a fool I am  
I should have turned away  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
To let it all hang out  
To fight my fear and fight my doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
(get ahold) of love  
Spoken words don't mean enough  
No mistake  
Remember not to break the promise that you make  
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now  
And I won't back out  
There'd better be no doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love was on our side  
I love you you know I  
You know I always will love you now  
I know I do love you  
You know I'll always be true to you my love  
Here you stand  
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand  
I wanna love you now  
Oh forget the past  
I wanna make love last  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Let it all hang out  
Love will bring you back again  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that I love will bring you back again

Donna Summer,I Remember Yesterday,/d/donna+summer/i+remember+yesterday_10087779.html,"I remember that first night we met,  
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets,  
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet,  
You and me and this fantasy,  
Oh I remember our first night.  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn.  
From the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part,  
Oh I remember that first night.  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.  
  
I saw your love light through the candle's glow,  
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go,  
And when the night was over, we both looked around the room,  
Remember darling, chairs on the table, and only me and you  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn,  
And from the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part.  
I remember that first night  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.

Donna Summer,I Will Survive,/d/donna+summer/i+will+survive_20344036.html,"At First I was afriad I was petrified kept  
Think how I'm going to live without you by me side?  
But, then I spend so many nights just thinking how you  
Did me wrong but I grew strong and I learned how to get along  
And now you back from outer space  
Don't turn around,  
Cause your not welcome any more,  
Weren't you the one who tried  
To hurt me with goodbye  
You'd think I'd crumble youd think I'd lay down and die  
Now go now go, walk out the door  
Don't turn around now cause your not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye  
You'd think i's crumble you'd think I'd lay down and die  
Oh no not I  
I will survive  
Oh as long as I know how to love i'll know i'll stay alive  
I 've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give I will survive  
I will survive hey hey hey

Donna Summer,Love's Unkind,/d/donna+summer/loves+unkind_10087856.html,"Well I seem him every morning in the schoolyard  
When the school bell rings  
And when he passes in the hallway  
Well he doesn't seem to notice me  
  
He's got a crush on my best friend  
But she don't care, 'cause she loves someone else  
I'm standing on the outside, no the inside where I wanna be  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'Cause he's not mine  
  
Just the other day I was praying that he'd give me a chance  
Hoping he would choose me for his partner  
For the high school dance  
I was standing outside the class  
  
But it wasn't me, but my best friend, he asked  
I went running back inside teary-eyed  
And left the two of them behind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'cause he's not mine  
  
Oh, how I love him, but I can't even let him know  
'cause he loves my best friend  
But she don't care, she loves someone else  
And I asked my mama, and she said: love's unkind  
  
Love's so unkind  
She said: just keep it alive  
'Cause you may find love's unkind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind

Why did I have to love him so

So much was said  
But nobody spoke a word  
  
So I took a chance  
And he followed me home  
I knew he wouldn't beg  
So I gave in without fighting  
  
Been so long since I've been this way  
Since I loved this way  
So I asked him if he would stay for a while  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
We talked a while  
And he told me nice  
We laughed and we cried and  
I knew that I could love him  
He got up to say goodbye  
I said where you going,  
He said that he must leave

Donna Summer,Lush Life,/d/donna+summer/lush+life_20042244.html,"I used to visit the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis  
Of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails  
  
All the men I knew had sad and  
Sullen gray faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there  
You could see where  
They'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your  
Siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I knew all the while  
That your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a  
Great love for me  
Oh, yes I was wrong  
Again I was wrong  
  
Now life is lonely again  
And only last year everything  
Seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A troughful of hearts would only  
Be a bore  
A week in Paris will ease the bite  
Of it  
But all I really care  
Is to smile in spite of it  
I'll forget you  
I will and yet you are still  
Burning inside my brain  
  
Romance is mush, stifling those  
Who strive  
I'll live a lush life in some  
Small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot with the rest  
Of those whose lives are  
Lonely too

You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said ""mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me""?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand  
Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight

If the music be the fruit of life  
Then let my music play  
  
Life is a dance  
Maybe we're all players  
So stand up and smile  
And don't you be afraid  
  
This is my life  
This is my song  
Standing right here out on  
The stage is where I belong  
  
This is your life  
This is my song  
This is my life  
Standing right here out on  
The stage in the spotlight

Donna Summer,My Man Medley,/d/donna+summer/my+man+medley_20042300.html,"Spoken:  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
(the man I love)  
Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
Spoken:  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all  
(I got it bad and that ain't good)  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good!  
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)  
Spoken:  
Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?  
And how about you?  
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!  
My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
Spoken:  
So you see on Monday nights  
I just go out and drink and drink  
But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'  
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out  
Cryin' my heart out  
Lord above me (come on) make him love me  
Then he should  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad and that ain't good!  
No it ain't good at all you know  
Spoken:  
But listen mister big shot I've got your number  
And I'll take care of you  
And you too and you and you and you  
(some of these days)  
Some of these days  
You're gonna miss your donna  
Some of these days  
You're gonna feel so lonely  
You'll miss my huggin'  
You'll miss my kissin'  
You'll miss me honey  
When you're far away  
You're gonna be so lonely  
For me only  
Cause you know daddy  
You had you way  
And if I leave you  
You know it's gonna grieve you  
You're gonna miss your sweet lovin' donna  
Some of these days  
And if I leave you  
You know it's gonna grieve you  
You're gonna miss your sweet little donna  
Some of these days  
Hey honey call me when you got time  
Know what I mean...

Donna Summer,Mystery Of Love,/d/donna+summer/mystery+of+love_20042245.html,"Seasons are changing  
Children of love are alive  
People reach out to survive  
Together  
  
Love is the message  
We carry across the sky  
Down through the passage of  
Time forever  
  
History unfolds  
As this story's told  
  
(And it's) the mystery of love  
How we go on and on forever  
(and it's) the mystery of love  
Coming to rescue  
Rescue me  
  
A man and a woman  
Lost in each other's embrace  
Star-crossed in time in a place  
Far away  
Innocent dreamers  
Turning the wheels of chance  
Searching to find romance  
Forever  
  
We will surely find  
Love is for all time  
  
(And it's) the mystery of love  
How we go on and on forever  
(and it's) the mystery of love  
Only one heart can turn the key  
Down through the history  
Of love  
Time is the one that holds  
The answer  
(and it's) the mystery of love  
Oh, will it set me free  
  
For all time

And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

What we believe  
And break us up where there is love

Donna Summer,The Man I Love,/d/donna+summer/the+man+i+love_20726014.html,"[Spoken:]  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
  
  
Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
  
[Spoken:]  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

Donna Summer,"Theme From The Deep (Down, Deep Inside)",/d/donna+summer/theme+from+the+deep+down+deep+inside_20805390.html,"Down deep inside  
There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore  
Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance  
It's what a stare and the dance were  
To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes  
Romance  
Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

Donna Summer,(Theme) Once Upon A Time,/d/donna+summer/theme+once+upon+a+time_20506811.html,"(Voice monologue over ""Once Upon A Time"" instrumental)  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

Feeling somewhat scared  
When I vacationed in a land that I  
Didn't know that well  
But all the ladies there were nice  
The gentlemen politely out of line  
I kept on thinking how I'd like  
To spend some time  
I couldn't make up my mind, still  
Waitin' for the right sign  
I was down in Tokyo  
Livin' in hotel Imperial  
Met this man, he was something  
Very strange  
Said he was a spy from somewhere  
Else way far away  
He told me things about myself that  
I could tell nobody else  
Passed this message on to me, said  
Spirits move in secrecy  
I could almost read the man's mind  
Waitin' for the right sign  
I really wanna know if I'm gonna go  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo  
He passed this message on to me  
Said spirits move in secrecy  
A double agent amnesty  
An Ian Fleming mystery  
I, I know I read the man's mind  
I know I got the right sign  
I really wanna know if I'm gonna go  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in

Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in

George Strait,Breath You Take,/g/george+strait/breath+you+take_20897750.html,"He looks up from second base  
Dad's up in the stands  
He saw the hit, the run, the slide  
There ain't no bigger fan  
  
In the parking lot after the game  
He said ""Dad I thought you had a plane to catch?""  
He smiled and said ""Yeah son I did""  
  
But life's not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Life's not the breaths you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Fast forward fifteen years  
And a thousand miles away  
Boys built a life, he's got a wife  
And a baby due today  
He hears a voice saying ""I made it son""  
Says ""I told you Dad, you didn't have to come""  
He smiles and says ""Yeah I know you did""  
  
But life's not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Life's not the breathes you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Just like it took my breath away when she was born  
Just like it took my breath away when Dad took his last that morn  
  
Life's not the breathes you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what it's all about  
You just might miss the point  
If you don't slow down the pace  
Life's not the breathes you take  
But the moments that take your breath away

The more she bakes the more I eat

'Cause it makes them taste better than they did at first  
And they're absolutely impossible to resist  
Some disappear to who knows where  
But I make sure I get my share  
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss

Before she gets the icing put on  
Sure do like those Christmas cookies, babe

That you might have overlooked or missed  
So now let me tell you the best part of it all  
Every time she sticks another batch in the oven  
There's 15 minutes for some kissin' and'a huggin'

And the stars are shining kinda extra bright  
Sitting on the back porch glidin'  
Whetting my appetite  
  
Well, I'm a six-pack high  
And start missing the light of my baby's eyes  
Wasn't it beautiful, the kind of a soul they said would never die  
  
Well, it's muggy in the shack  
And the backwoods are black  
'Cause the clouds hid the moon away  
The light from my cigarette flickers in the dark  
The only way she knows I'm here  
Then suddenly the sounds of the fiddles and accordions  
Sweetly begin to play and I can almost hear her sweet voice say

Pull yourself together again  
And come on Joe, you gotta get hold of this mood you're in  
Come on Joe, you gotta be strong  
You're still young and life goes on to carry on  
'Til we're together again  
  
Hey, I know she's right  
But it's hard to fight when you're hurtin' so  
I tried to walk out of that door before but I just can't go  
With the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room  
Wasn't it beautiful  
Wasn't it the kind of happiness and glow

Drink one more cold one, come mornin' get up

And a three letter word  
That rhymes with through  
Oh I get it, that's you  
  
Never believed in horoscopes  
But to the left of the ad  
For a new dishwashin' soap  
Dear Abby's got some good advice  
For a troubled couple lost in paradise  
  
In the Living section  
Page two  
  
What's four down and twelve across  
Two letter synonym for lost  
That's me  
And a three letter word  
That rhymes with through  
Oh, I get it  
  
That's you, that's me, that's us  
Sometimes love ain't enough  
We try and try  
For the life of me, why did we give up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's me  
Oh, that's us  
What's four down and twelve across That's us

George Strait,Frosty The Snowman,/g/george+strait/frosty+the+snowman_20059526.html,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn cop pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made out of snow  
But the children know how he came to life one day  
There must of been some magic in  
That ol' silk cap they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day  
So he said lets run and have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there all around the square  
Sayin' catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' please don't cry  
I'll be back again some day

Just reminded me of that day  
  
When that front door swung wide open  
She flung her diamond ring  
Said, give it away  
Just give it away  
  
And I said, now honey  
Don't you even want your half of everything

And a lonely, broken heart  
Full of love

Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.

This morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break  
So 'til she returns, I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
I'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again  
With love and understanding, I'll give her reasons this time to stay  
And I'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change  
And I won't be left lonely,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
Yes, the devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But Lord I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain

George Strait,"Love Without End, Amen",/g/george+strait/love+without+end+amen_20059518.html,"I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye.  
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why.  
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed.  
And then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst.  
  
Chorus:  
And he said, let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  
A secret that my daddy said was just between us.  
He said, daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.  
  
When I became a father in the spring of '81  
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son.  
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end,  
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him.  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates.  
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake.  
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in.  
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again.  
  
Repeat chorus

There's a cool breeze blowin' off the bay  
And a warm flame dancin' with our shadows  
To music playin' far away  
I never meant to stay an hour  
I thought that I was passing through  
Another town along the highway  
I never meant to fall for you  
  
[Chorus]  
But I can't speak for you Maria  
I only know the way I feel  
When I sleep with you, Maria  
There's nothing left for dreams to steal  
  
On a Bible by the mirror  
The only treasures that we hold  
The only secrets that we're keepin'  
A watch, a chain, a cross of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the sunlight brings the mornin'  
I can't tell you what I'll do  
But I've a mind to take you with me  
And I've got heart to stay with you

Don't that sun look good going down  
Don't that ol' army cot look lonely  
When your lover ain't no place around  
  
Well I tried everything baby  
To get along with you  
Now I'm gonna tell you  
What I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna stop my cryin'  
Gonna leave you alone  
And if you don't think I'm leavin' big momma  
Just count the days I'm gone  
You ain't gonna see me  
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more

Where in this world I've gone

At least a hundred of times since you've been gone  
I've seen a lot of ol' familiar faces  
But again tonight I'm goin' home alone  
  
My heart won't let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do  
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new  
But my heart won't let me love no one but you  
  
I've told myself a million times it's over  
You've gotta face the truth and let her go  
Just when I think I've got it all together

My arms keep reachin' out for someone new

Nobody in his right mind  
could've left her

to stay behind  
  
I still carry her picture  
I wish her well

each day I spend thinkin'  
How much I wish  
she was still around

An' a hot cup of coffee,  
And sit out on the front porch and swing.  
That look in your eyes is what's on my mind:  
We don't have to say anything.  
Let's just listen to that old tin roof sing.

The magic never melts away  
It only takes a Christmas Day  
To make it reappear

I'm gonna meet a lot of resistance  
It takes every ounce of strength we've got  
If we're gonna go the distance  
We can get discouraged and lose our courage  
Worrying 'bout the daily grind  
But life's a journey, no need to hurry  
It's one day at a time  
  
[Chorus]  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step then take another  
Keep on walkin', we're headed in the right direction  
Puttin' one foot in front of the other  
Little by little gets a whole lot further  
Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
What's down the road we can't say  
And the road behind don't matter  
But every mile along the way  
Is just another mile together  
Unconcerned about the twists and turns  
We're takin' it nice and slow  
Safe and sound, covering ground  
Steady as she goes

Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow takes care of itself  
We'll just keep on keepin' on  
'Cause we ain't stumbled yet  
  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step and then take another  
Just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction  
Just puttin' one foot in front of the other  
Little by little gets a whole lot further  
Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
Well, just a-hittin' our stride  
One foot in front of the other

Gordon Lightfoot,A Lesson In Love,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+lesson+in+love_20061565.html,"""Nothing is for certain""  
That's what the showman said  
First you must open the curtain  
And stand 'em on their heads  
There can be no inhibitions  
No prima donna ways  
If you want to pass the audition  
And times is tough these days  
Remember when Mr. Barnum  
Presented Jenny Lind  
They named a candy after her  
A circus after him  
End of my story  
The rest is history  
She in all of her glory  
He lived quietly  
He needed her, she needed him  
As sure as the skies above  
In a way it was for them  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love  
You look like the moon glow  
That follows me home  
Always makes me turn around  
Won't leave me alone  
First to come are the midgets  
A monkey and a kid  
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers  
The ego and the id  
Songs of the season  
Apples of the sun  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just a time for each and every one  
Hang on Mr. Barnum  
Hang on Jenny Lind  
We will meet you in streets of gold  
Where eternity begins  
We will let it all hangout  
Go hand in glove  
Life was meant to live and learn  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love

I have found the open ocean  
Give me no lip  
The waves roll by as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the first day of April  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me when I'm gone?  
How many words  
How many songs still unwritten?  
How many ships  
Of the line have come and gone?  
In the good old days  
May they never be forgotten  
They had heavy wind  
Or they had no wind at all  
A passing ship  
It is midnight on the ocean  
Had a real long trip  
I have been at sea all winter  
When my ship came in  
I was givin' up the ghost  
I think I should be  
Leavin' those passing ships alone  
When the sea runs high  
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady  
And I think of you  
In the warmth of your home and family  
When love is true  
There is no truer occupation  
And may this gale  
Blow us to the ones we love  
Another day, another ocean  
Give me no lip  
But stand aside as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the last day in October  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me from now on?  
I guess I should be  
Leavin' passing ships alone

And the streets and brown and gritty

There in my mind in it now shines  
A guiding light

Gordon Lightfoot,Ballad Of Yarmouth Castle,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ballad+of+yarmouth+castle_20061662.html,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon  
And the anchors have been weighed  
From Miami to Nassau  
She's bound across the waves  
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay  
Into the open sea  
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it  
Now the many years she's been to sea  
She's seen the better times  
She gives a groan of protest  
As they cast away her lines  
And the grumble of her engines  
And the rust along her spine  
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'  
But the sands run out within her heart  
A tiny spark glows red  
It smolders through the evening  
There's laughter overhead  
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt  
And the drinks are passed around  
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'  
Now it's midnight on the open sea  
And the moon is shinin' bright  
Some people join the party  
And others say goodnight  
There's many who are sleepin' now  
It's been a busy day  
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'  
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning  
Let someone understand""  
But her silent plea is wasted  
In the playin' of the band  
Everybody's dancin' on her deck  
And they're havin' such a time  
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""  
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle  
The fire begins to glow  
It leaps into the hallways  
And climbs and twists and grows  
And the paint she wore to keep her young  
Oh Lord, how well it burns  
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'  
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast  
The captain stands aloft  
He calls up to the boatswain, says  
""Boatswain, we are lost""  
For the ragged hoses in the racks  
No pressure do they hold  
And the people down below will soon be dyin'  
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now  
It's spreadin' fore and aft  
The people are a-scramblin'  
As the fire blocks their path  
The evil smoke surrounds them  
And they're fallin' in their tracks  
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'  
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star  
Comes steamin' through the night  
She sees the Castle blazin'  
And 'tis a terrible sight  
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries  
""We'll save you if we can""  
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'  
""God help the ones who sleep below  
And cannot find the way  
Thank God for those we rescue  
Upon this awful day""  
Now the heroes, they are many  
But the times are growin' slim  
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'  
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'  
She's cryin' like a child  
You can hear her if you listen  
Above the roar so wild  
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie  
Within her molten sides?  
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'  
But the livin' soon were rescued  
The ones who lived to tell  
From the Star they watched her  
As she died there in the swells  
Like a toy ship on a mill pond  
She burned all through the night  
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'

Gordon Lightfoot,Beautiful,/g/gordon+lightfoot/beautiful_20162031.html,"At times I just don't know  
How you could be anything but beautiful  
I think that I was made for you  
And you were made for me  
  
And I know that I won't ever change  
We've been friends through rain or shine  
For such a long, long time  
  
Laughing eyes and smiling face  
It seems so lucky just to have the right  
Of telling you with all my might  
You're beautiful tonight  
  
And I know that you won't ever stray  
Cause you've been that way from day to day  
For such a long, long time  
  
And when you hold me tight  
How could life be anything but beautiful  
I think that I was made for you  
And you were made for me  
  
And I know that I won't ever change  
We've been friends through rain or shine  
For such a long, long time  
  
Well, I must say it means so much to me  
To be the one who's telling you  
I'm telling you, that you're beautiful.

With my banjo in my hand  
I don't need no long vacation  
In some foreign land  
Cause the sound of my own breathing  
Has been turning to a sigh  
I wish that I could make the time  
To be in biscuit city by and by  
Oh the water is of emerald  
And the beach is white as snow  
And everyone's got money  
And no place to go  
In a land of milk and honey  
It can really make you smile  
And if I had a ticket  
I would stay in biscuit city for a while  
All the girls are in bikinis  
All the boys are in the buff  
With the baby in between and  
That makes three of us  
And the streets are all so quiet  
And the walls are squeaky clean  
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til  
The town of biscuit city you have seen  
I'd rather be in biscuit city  
With my banjo in my hand  
Than take a big vacation  
In some foreign land  
Cause the sound of my own breathing  
Has been turning to a sigh  
If it were not for misfortune  
I would be in biscuit city by and by  
If it were not for misfortune  
I would stay in biscuit city 'til I die

Gordon Lightfoot,Bitter Green,/g/gordon+lightfoot/bitter+green_20061510.html,"Upon the Bitter Green she walked the hills above the town  
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown  
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears  
Waiting through the years  
  
[Chorus]  
Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met  
Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun  
Waiting for someone to take her home  
  
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea  
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust  
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
[Chorus]

Gordon Lightfoot,Black Day In July,/g/gordon+lightfoot/black+day+in+july_20061532.html,"Black day in July  
Motor city madness has touched the countryside  
And through the smoke and cinders  
You can hear it far and wide  
The doors are quickly bolted  
And the children locked inside  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land  
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands  
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound  
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground  
Upon the filthy pavement  
No reason can be found  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor City madness has touched the countryside  
And the people rise in anger  
And the streets begin to fill  
And there's gunfire from the rooftops  
And the blood begins to spill  
  
Black day in July  
  
In the mansion of the governor  
There's nothing that is known for sure  
The telephone is ringing  
And the pendulum is swinging  
And they wonder how it happened  
And they really know the reason  
And it wasn't just the temperature  
And it wasn't just the season  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild  
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake  
And everyone is listening  
And everyone's awake  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
The printing press is turning  
And the news is quickly flashed  
And you read your morning paper  
And you sip your cup of tea  
And you wonder just in passing  
Is it him or is it me  
  
Black day in July  
  
In the office of the President  
The deed is done the troops are sent  
There's really not much choice you see  
It looks to us like anarchy  
And then the tanks go rolling in  
To patch things up as best they can  
There is no time to hesitate  
The speech is made the dues can wait  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene  
But the shapes of gutted buildings  
Strike terror to the heart  
And you say how did it happen  
And you say how did it start  
Why can't we all be brothers  
Why can't we live in peace  
But the hands of the have-nots  
Keep falling out of reach  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor city madness has touched the countryside  
And through the smoke and cinders  
You can hear it far and wide  
The doors are quickly bolted  
And the children locked inside

And one more heel's been killed

His old recipe in his will

Sounds of laughter on faces gray  
Yesterday's a carousel  
Catch the ring and all will be well  
From the coast of California  
Up to the Oregon border  
I've thumbed a thousand miles I guess  
Sitting in a roadside diner  
The big trucks rollin' by  
I don't seem to know at times what's best  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario  
If you're drivin' east to Reno  
Or north to Mendocino  
I hope you find your rainbow?s end  
This highway is my rainbow  
And though I might regret it  
I'm so glad I said it way back when  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario

Gordon Lightfoot,Canadian Railroad Trilogy,/g/gordon+lightfoot/canadian+railroad+trilogy_20061665.html,"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
  
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds  
As to this verdant country they came from all around  
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall  
And they built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us  
All  
  
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring  
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring  
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day  
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay  
  
For they looked in the future and what did they see  
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea  
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land  
All up through the seaports and into their hands  
  
Look away said they across this mighty land  
From the eastern shore to the western strand  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails  
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails  
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow  
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails  
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails  
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow  
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'  
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day  
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping  
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done  
  
So over the mountains and over the plains  
Into the muskeg and into the rain  
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe  
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay  
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down  
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town  
A dollar a day and a place for my head  
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead  
  
Oh the song of the future has been sung  
All the battles have been won  
O'er the mountain tops we stand  
All the world at our command  
We have opened up the soil  
With our teardrops and our toil  
  
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
And many are the dead men too silent to be real.

Where will you go when night closes in?  
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?  
Where will it stop?  
Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly  
All we need is a friend I guess  
With my midnight star to guide through  
Clouds of loneliness  
You knew someone but was it love?  
So many years, push came to shove  
You had a dream, so they had one too  
You turned away, they were untrue  
In our early days we were too willing  
At the time we had yet to arrive  
Many a man and a woman found  
Trying to stay alive  
Where will you go? What will you do  
When your whole world ain't talking to you?  
Maybe you think you will see the light  
Baby, it's time you hope it's right  
And I'm all dressed up to be somebody  
All I need is a friendly face  
With my midnight crowd to glide through  
Clouds of empty space  
Seems like every time we turn around  
What we see could be anyone's guess  
Many a man and a woman found in  
Clouds of loneliness

When I was a child and my mother smiled  
At the cradle she bought  
For the little tot she held to her breast  
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love  
It was all that I heard  
Till the powers that be took a liking to me  
And they told me that love was a four-letter word  
Don't beat me down  
Don't beat me down  
I've got one life to live  
And that's all I can give  
So don't beat me down  
And now I've got a place, I got a worried face  
And a question in mind  
Please let me find a reason somehow  
Why some reap the harvest while other men die  
And the joker runs wild  
And if powers that be take a liking to us  
Then we all must return to the ways of a child  
We all must return to the ways of a child

suitcase in her hand.  
Her fate she pondered, only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care.  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving.  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her,  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way,  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one.  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere.  
  
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended,  
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended.  
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears,  
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him.

There'll be no one to hold my hand  
If there's a God up there he loves me  
As much as my old women can  
  
I don't intend to be a martyr  
I don't give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
I've tasted life both good and evil  
At times I was cruel and did not pay  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
I don't know what it was I came for  
But I've enjoyed it up 'till until now  
If there's a friend who ever needs me  
I'll do my best to help somehow  
  
I don't intend to keep no secrets  
I don't give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven  
Heaven don't deserve me anyway  
  
I know and I'll admit my failures  
I don't give a damn what people say  
And if I never get to heaven

Gordon Lightfoot,Hi'way Songs,/g/gordon+lightfoot/hiway+songs_20061611.html,"When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I have played on my guitar  
In coffeehouses, hall and bars  
Everyone that I call friend  
Knows they will not be forgot  
Trains and planes and rented cars  
Singers, saints and other starts  
I suspect them every one  
They'll never change, it's too much fun  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I stand on my own sod  
It feels so good to be home, by God  
The winter wind has turned my head  
But I always came up warm somehow  
Bottles, beads and cigarettes  
And lovers that I ain't found yet  
Pickin' with a friend till dawn  
And singing all of those hi'way songs  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I would travel all my life  
If loneliness was not the price  
While headin' north across that line's  
The only time I'm flyin'

And let you dream away till the morning light returned again  
To take you away from me  
If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old  
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold  
Would I stand in the marketplace before  
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall  
And shot by the man in blue  
If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion  
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning  
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand  
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free  
Would it mean anything to you  
If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor  
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time  
I would turn his head away to the river  
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free  
For everyone to see  
If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world  
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea

A movie queen to play the scene  
Of bringing all the good things out in me,

Where lovers come to meet  
A hobo walked up to me, I could tell  
He didn't have enough to eat  
He said, ""good sir you look so kind

And when you're on your island  
Will you wave at every ship that passes by  
And will you feed a hungry man

And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But I'm stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes, my friend  
She's movin' out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
She's away and westward bound  
High above the clouds she'll fly  
  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines.  
She'll be flyin' o'er my home  
In about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down  
Ain't no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
  
You can't hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way

To ruffle up her skin  
All her sap runs free  
And sticks to me  
Hidden deep within

And dreams like these must not pass on  
But the brave keep falling to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before  
And the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
And the brave keep falling to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before  
And the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
The leaves of grass will not pass on  
Though the millstones grind them into dust  
For the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more

Gordon Lightfoot,Let It Ride,/g/gordon+lightfoot/let+it+ride_20061571.html,"These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you  
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true  
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun  
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find  
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind  
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind  
I just let it ride  
I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night  
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight  
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground  
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found  
He just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots  
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops  
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot  
They just let it ride  
One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by  
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried  
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light  
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night  
They just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal  
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all  
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon  
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride

Gordon Lightfoot,Long River,/g/gordon+lightfoot/long+river_20061599.html,"Where the long river flows  
It flows by my window  
Where the tall timber grows  
It grows 'round my door  
Where the mountains meet the sky  
And the white clouds fly  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
There's a tiny bird that calls  
And he calls by my window  
There's a lonely tear that falls  
And it falls 'round my door  
But when the sun is high  
There's no time to cry  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
Now if only you could see  
The closin' of the day  
If only you could be  
Where the dawn breaks away  
By the white cascade  
Oh down in the glade  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
Well when this land was made  
It was made full of wonder  
But one woman's love  
I can't understand  
And I'd give it all to you  
If her love were true  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
Where the long river flows

I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal

From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul  
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge  
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge  
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned  
That any time I've wandered I always have returned  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha  
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw  
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill  
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear  
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear  
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can  
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Says Bill, ""The air is clean tonight"", as he puffs a big cigar  
""And if this rig keeps rolling, my boy you'll travel far  
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize  
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by""  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Gordon Lightfoot,Long Way Back Home,/g/gordon+lightfoot/long+way+back+home_20061515.html,"From the railhead to the boatyard  
From the factory to the farm  
From the mine to the mill yard  
I've weathered the storm  
From the bar room to the bedpost  
I've wasted my days, all I have is my drink  
And the time left to think  
While time slips away  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
Now in case you should ask me  
What it is that I've done  
I'd say I'm a soldier  
Who once had a son  
But my son doesn't know me  
That's his right to choose  
Oh say, can you see? My best friend is me  
I'm a friend I could use  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
Now the pages have faded  
The story grows cold  
And the plot falls to ashes  
Like the ruins of old  
Those rats in my rafters  
They're after my shoes  
And anything else they can find on the shelf  
I've said they could use  
And just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
It's a long way back home

Of love lost running though

Watching it spin  
The leaves along the street  
You win  
  
Waiting for a line to fall  
Telling you it's all a big mistake  
  
Looking at a face  
So out of place  
Inside that picture frame  
Of lace  
Looking at the wall  
Wishing you'd call  
And tell me you're okay  
That's all  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake  
  
Looking at the trees  
So ill at ease  
From sleep that will not come  
That's me  
Looking at the dawn  
Knowing it's wrong  
Still thinking of your love  
That's gone  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake

Where she'd run to meet him, by the garden wall  
Oh my sweet Miguel, I will never tell  
No one will ever know, what I know too well  
And he'd smile and lay his head on her breast and he'd say I have no fear  
They're waiting for me to cross the border, to swim the river  
'Cause I've done that before  
To see my true loves smiling face  
A hundred times or more

I'll love you till I die

The child of a man who had soon gone away  
But his mother loved him dearly and she would take him yearly  
To the great Cathedral in St. Augustine  
Oh my young Miguel, listen to the bell  
Of my poverty you must never tell  
And he cried himself to sleep in the night  
And he vowed to make things right  
So he took the gun down from the wall and he paid a call  
He knew she'd understand  
A lawman came to capture him  
The gun jumped in his hand  
Oh Miguel the mother cried  
You must run son or you'll die  
So the story is told of his true love cross the line  
As strong as the oak and as sweet as the vine  
And the child she bore him, came on the fateful mornin'  
When they sent him to his final rest  
Oh my sweet Miguel listen to the bell  
No one will ever know, of what I know too well  
Then she'd smile and lay the child on her breast  
And she'd say I have no fear

And everything that I could pack to see me on my way

Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind  
North of the border or down in South Bend

To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free

Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

Gordon Lightfoot,Ribbon Of Darkness,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ribbon+of+darkness_20061603.html,"Ribbon of darkness over me  
Since my true love walked out the door  
Tears I never had before  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Clouds a-atherin' o'er my head  
That kill the day and hide the sun  
That shroud the night when day is done  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Rain is falling on the meadow  
Where once my love and I did lie  
Now she is gone from the meadow  
My love goodbye  
  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
Where once the world was young as spring  
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Here in this cold room lyin'  
Don't want to see no one but you  
Lord I wish I could be dyin'  
To forget you  
  
Oh how I wish your heart could see  
How mine just aches and breaks all day  
Come on home and take away  
This ribbon of darkness over me

Gordon Lightfoot,Ring Them Bells,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ring+them+bells_20061722.html,"Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams  
Ring them bell from the sanctuaries, 'cross the valleys and streams  
For they're deep and they're wide, and the world's on its side  
And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride  
Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel of the plow  
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep  
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the game is through?  
Ring them bells for the time that flies  
For the child who cries when innocence dies  
Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof  
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom  
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong  
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong

Gordon Lightfoot,Rosanna,/g/gordon+lightfoot/rosanna_20061689.html,"Rosanna makes my day begin  
With kisses for a king  
And coffee on a silver tray  
She sees the shape I'm in  
And if she should ever break away  
I'd follow close behind her

Rules my heart  
  
Rosanna knows the times I keep  
A fire softly glows  
And the shadows lick the walls  
She knows when I'm asleep  
The dinner's served at eight o'clock on time  
And all is well by nine  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rules my heart  
  
Rosanna moves across the floor  
Her perfume fills the air  
As she walks beside my easy chair  
I touch her hand once more  
And I may never sleep again  
I like the bag she put me in  
  
Rosanna knows the ways of a man  
But not the way I feel  
I don't really care what happens now  
It's catch me if you can  
For no matter what occasion should arise  
She likes to sympathize  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
Rules my heart

I hope all the mistakes you made were a lot like mine  
Lovin' girls too much sometimes they made you cry  
Maybe we've got more livin' to do with a lot less pain  
Here, let's drink to you  
These are the words i knew would break the ice  
I held my hand out and he shook it twice  
It seemed to me like i'd been here before  
Deja vu, familiar voice  
And the salute of my choice  
  
Salute gentlemen of days gone by  
Ladies of leisure and of flashing eye  
May some romantic fool turn on your light  
As for me i'm in between  
All that i can do is dream  
  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
And a lot more lovin' too  
When you make it through the night with no end in sight  
And the dawn peeks through  
You got a lot more livin' to do  
  
Salute nightingales upon the tide  
Brothers of the cloth tonight who must be tried  
May all of your martinis be forever dry  
As for me i'm in between  
All that i can do is dream  
  
You got a lot more livin' to do

I'll show the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen see  
  
I live in the shade of a forest of green  
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen  
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails  
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails  
  
There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze  
There's love and romancin' as nice as you please  
There's otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs  
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs  
  
There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout  
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out  
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares  
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care  
  
So if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by  
Come down around midnight and give us a try  
We'll show you the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen to see

Gordon Lightfoot,Seven Island Suite,/g/gordon+lightfoot/seven+island+suite_20061676.html,"Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn  
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born  
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware  
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west  
To the sunset you can see it, all in fiery autumn dress  
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs  
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused  
  
Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way  
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say  
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck  
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck  
  
Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can  
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand  
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste  
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face  
  
It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest  
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold  
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold  
  
If you feel it you better believe it, you're gonna see it, so you really  
know  
It is rising like a feather, dipping and dancing from below  
There's a new wave that is breaking in the wake of a passing ship  
Every nation's gonna be shaken, put it together, don't let it slip  
  
It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest

Gordon Lightfoot,Sit Down Young Stranger,/g/gordon+lightfoot/sit+down+young+stranger_20061592.html,"I'm standin' at the doorway  
My head bowed in my hands  
Not knowin' where to sit  
Not knowin' where I stand  
My father looms above me  
For him there is no rest  
My mothers arms enfold me  
And hold me to her breast  
They say you been out wanderin'  
They say you travelled far  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us who you are  
The room has all gone misty  
My thoughts are all in spin  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us where you been  
Well, I've been up to the mountain  
I've walked down by the sea  
I never questioned no one  
And no one questioned me  
My love was given freely  
And oftimes was returned  
I never came to borrow  
I only came to learn  
Sometimes it did get lonely  
But it taught me how to cry  
And laughter came too easy  
For life to pass me by  
I never had a dollar  
That I didn't earn with pride  
'Cause I had a million daydreams  
To keep me satisfied  
And will you gather daydreams  
Or will you gather wealth  
How can you find your fortune  
When you cannot find yourself?  
My mothers eyes grow misty  
There's a tremblin' in her hand  
Sit down young stranger  
I do not understand  
And will you try and tell us  
You've been too long at school  
That knowledge is not needed  
That power does not rule  
That war is not the answer  
That young men should not die  
Sit down young stranger  
I wait for your reply  
The answer is not easy  
For souls are not reborn  
To wear the crown of peace  
You must wear the crown of thorns  
If Jesus, had a reason  
I'm sure He would not tell  
They treated Him so badly  
How could He wish them well  
The parlor now is empty  
There's nothin' left to say  
My father has departed  
My mothers gone to pray  
There's rockets in the meadows  
And ships out on the sea  
The answers in the forest  
Are carved upon a tree  
John loves Mary  
Does anyone love me?

Each and every rose bud you will find me gone  
So knock me down and pick me up  
And knock me down again  
Break my heart steal my gold  
And slander my good name  
Seven lonely hours on the morning train  
Takes me to a place where I won't come back again  
Seven lonely Pullmans speedin' down the line  
Takin' me away from an old love of mine  
  
Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines  
In some hidden valley where the twirlin' river twines  
Where the fish swim up and down  
And the sparklin' water falls  
Where the thunder rolls  
And the lonely puma calls  
  
Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name  
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again  
Somewhere in the wilderness  
I'll build a cabin small  
Then forget so I  
Won't remember you at all

When I'm drinking to you

Sometimes I don't mind a good time  
Sometimes I do what's best

When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in the mouth tell me what can I do

Sometimes I need the change  
Sometimes I don't mind a fun time

The snow is softly fallin'  
The air is still within the silence of my room  
I hear your voice softly callin'  
  
If I could only have you near  
To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead  
My glass is almost empty  
I read again between the lines upon the page  
The words of love you sent me  
  
If I could know within my heart  
That you were lonely too  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim  
The shades of night are liftin'  
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane  
Where webs of snow are driftin'  
  
If I could only have you near  
To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
And to be once again with with you  
To be once again with with you

And his suit was the shade of evergreen  
The folks he knew, hadn't naught to fear  
When the sheriff was there, they were over here

Was the kind of a scene where he never failed  
There was no man on the sea or land

The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line

Just to watch her lying there  
Disowned and ragged princess  
With the sun locked in her hair  
So cold, so frail  
With her mind locked in a jail  
The victim of confusion  
Never knowing she could fail

Then I got up on my feet  
And the day was filled with sunshine  
As I gazed across the street  
And the door seemed to say  
Over here, step this way  
The station is for travelers  
Even you must ride someday  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder

He practiced calling bids both night and day  
Till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm  
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer.  
And his pop said ""Son, we just can't stand to have a mediocre man  
Selling things at auction using our good name.  
Gonna send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool  
And you can take your place among the best.""  
  
Thirty five dolla bidja now forty doller forty, wouldja megga forty bidya on a  
Forty doller forty doller wouldja gimme forty, wouldja gimme forty dollar
bill?  
I gotta forty dollar bidya now, five, wouldja biddle on a forty-five, bidgel
on  
A forty-five, forty-five. Who's gunna bidda the forty-five dollar bill?  
  
And from that boy that went to school there grew a man who played it cool,  
He come back home a full fledged auctioneer.  
And the people would come from miles around  
Just to hear him make that rhythmic sound  
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer.  
And his fame spread out from shore to shore, he'd all that he could do and
more,  
He had to buy a plane to get around.  
Well, now he's the best in all the land, let's pause and give that man a  
Handcause he's the best of all the auctioneers  
  
Forty-five dollar bidja now, fifty dollar fifty wouldja make it fifty biddle  
Onna fifty dolla fifty dolla. Wouldja gimme fifty, wouldja gimme fifty dolla  
Bill? I gotta fifty dolla bidja now, five, wouldja biddle onna fifty-five,  
Biddle onna fifty-five, fifty-five. Who's gonna bitta the fifty five dollar  
Bill?  
  
Well I sold that hoss for fifty dollar bill!

Gordon Lightfoot,The House You Live In,/g/gordon+lightfoot/the+house+you+live+in_20061658.html,"Go first in the world, go forth with your fears  
Remember a price must be paid  
Be always too soon, be never too fast  
At the time when all bets must be laid  
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children  
Remember the woman who waits  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
  
When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail  
Beware of the dangers below  
And the song that you sing should not be too sad  
And be sure not to sing it too slow  
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces  
And know what they're doin' it for  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost  
Consider the burden of fame  
And he who is wise will not criticize  
When other men fail at the game  
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places  
Be careful while bending the law  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal  
Decide what it is that you need  
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live  
Or is it the mouth you must feed  
Be known as a man who will always be candid  
On questions that do not relate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate

Three by three, they danced on the sea,  
Four by four, they danced on the shore,  
Five by five, they tried to survive,  
Six by six, they were playing with tricks.  
  
How many paths did they try and fail?  
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?  
How much poison did they inhale?  
How many black cats crossed their trail?  
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,  
Eight by eight, they got to the gate,  
Nine by nine, they drank the wine,  
Ten by ten, they drank again.  
  
How many tomorrow's have are they given away?  
How many compared to yesterday?  
How many more without any reward?  
How many more can they afford?  
Two by two, they stepped into the ark,  
Two by two, they step in the dark.  
Three by three, they're turning the key,  
Four by four, they turn it some more,  
One by one, they follow the sun,  
Two by two, to another rendezvous.

And where have you been my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'  
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And what'll you do now my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'  
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest  
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Bob Dylan,Abandoned Love,/b/bob+dylan/abandoned+love_20021632.html,"I can hear the turning of the key  
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.  
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain  
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.  
  
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost  
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?  
  
Everybody's wearing a disguise  
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.  
But me, I can't cover what I am  
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you I'm not free.  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?  
  
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,  
The pot of gold is only make-believe.  
The treasure can't be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,  
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.  
My head tells me it's time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.  
  
One more time at midnight, near the wall  
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.  
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.

But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.

But the river-boat captain he knows my fate  
But ev'rybody else, even yourself

Bob Dylan,Ain't Talkin',/b/bob+dylan/aint+talkin_20538895.html,"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden  
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell  
I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others  
But oh, mother, things ain't going well  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost  
  
Now I'm all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""

While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.  
  
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.  
  
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'

Bob Dylan,As I Went Out One Morning,/b/bob+dylan/as+i+went+out+one+morning_20021402.html,"As I went out one morning  
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,  
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,  
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

Bob Dylan,Ballad For A Friend,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+for+a+friend_20155922.html,"Sad I'm sittin' on the railroad track,  
Watchin' that old smokestack.  
Train is a-leavin' but it won't be back.  
  
Years ago we hang around,  
Watchin' trains roll through the town.  
Now that train is a-graveyard bound.  
  
Where we go up in that North country,  
Lakes and streams and mines so free,  
I had no better friend than he.  
  
Something happened to him that day,  
I thought I heard a stranger say,  
I hung my head and stole away.  
  
A diesel truck was headin' down,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
It left him on a Utah road.  
  
They carried him back to his home town,  
His mother cried, his sister moaned,  
Listenin' to them church bells tone.  
  
A diesel truck was rollin' slow,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
And it left him on a Utah road.

Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+in+plain+d_20021147.html,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

Bob Dylan,Ballad Of A Thin Man,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+of+a+thin+man_20021423.html,"You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand  
You see somebody naked and you say, ""Who is that man?""  
You try so hard but you don't understand  
Just what you will say when you get home  
Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You raise up your head and you ask, ""Is this where it is?""  
And somebody points to you and says, ""It's his""  
And you say, ""What's mine?"" and somebody else says, ""Well, what is?""  
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""  
But something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek  
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak  
And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?""  
And you say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone  
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks  
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination  
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check  
To tax-deductible charity organizations  
  
Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks  
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks  
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books  
You're very well-read, it's well-known  
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels  
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels  
And he says, ""Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan""  
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word ""Now""  
And you say, ""For what reason?"" and he says, ""How""  
And you say, ""What does this mean?"" and he screams back, ""You're a cow!  
Give me some milk or else go home""  
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown  
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground  
There ought to be a law against you comin' around  
You should be made to wear earphones  
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?

Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith

Bob Dylan,Black Diamond Bay,/b/bob+dylan/black+diamond+bay_20021331.html,"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

Bob Dylan,Blue Moon,/b/bob+dylan/blue+moon_20021514.html,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.  
  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for.  
  
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""  
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own.

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's 115Th Dream,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+115th+dream_20021320.html,"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,

Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,  
From across that lonesome ocean.  
  
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine  
Made of silver or of golden,  
Either from the mountains of Madrid  
Or from the coast of Barcelona.  
  
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night  
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,  
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,

That I might be gone a long time

Is there something I can send you to remember me by,  
To make your time more easy passin'.  
  
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,  
It only brings me sorrow.  
The same thing I want from you today,  
I would want again tomorrow.  
  
I got a letter on a lonesome day,  
It was from her ship a-sailin',  
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,  
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.  
  
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,  
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.  
I'm sure your heart is not with me,  
But with the country to where you're goin'.  
  
So take heed, take heed of the western wind,  
Take heed of the stormy weather.  
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,  
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue.

Some on their way up  
Some on their way down

Bob Dylan,Caribbean Wind,/b/bob+dylan/caribbean+wind_20021635.html,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost  
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.  
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.  
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,  
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain  
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.  
  
Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which  
From one to another she could to easily switch  
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.  
Could I been used and played as a pawn?  
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on  
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,  
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there,  
There were payments due and he was a little behind.  
  
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,  
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,  
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,  
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing  
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,  
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.  
  
Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.  
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,

To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,/b/bob+dylan/changing+of+the+guards_20021554.html,"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

Your seasons full of cheer  
But 'til it's January

I will forever be.  
  
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.  
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up  
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,  
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
Covenant woman, intimate little girl  
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.  
You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.  
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.

Bob Dylan,'Cross The Green Mountain,/b/bob+dylan/cross+the+green+mountain_20175524.html,"I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I, I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Can't be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
It's the last day's last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
There's blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair nature's light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
You're walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The ground's froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But he'll be better soon  
He's in a hospital bed  
But he'll never be better  
He's already dead  
  
I'm ten miles outside the city  
And I'm lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day  
  
They were calm, they were gloomed  
We knew them all too well  
We loved each other more than  
We ever dared to tell

The birdies were flying from tree to tree.  
There was little to say, there was no conversation  
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.  
And the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,  
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.  
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',  
But the next time I looked there was light in the room.  
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,  
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',  
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees.  
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,  
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.  
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,  
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,  
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,  
Sure was glad to get out of there alive.  
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,  
Singing for me, well, singing for me.

Bob Dylan,Days Of 49,/b/bob+dylan/days+of+49_20021516.html,"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days  
They call me a bummer and a gin shot too, but what cares I for praise ?  
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign  
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew  
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true  
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine  
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight  
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight  
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein  
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game  
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same  
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind  
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget  
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet  
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design  
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast  
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost  
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign  
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And there's nowhere there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Oh the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Shines in dark and empty skies  
  
When the cities are on fire  
When the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is nt the end  
And you search in vain to find  
  
Just one law abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.

Bob Dylan,Desolation Row,/b/bob+dylan/desolation+row_20021424.html,"They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting  
the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me I  
Believe""  
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave""  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

And he carries all his money  
In a diamond-studded jar.  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law.  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,  
Did offer him my hand,  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand.  
  
And I nearly starved to death, boys,  
He did mistreat me so,  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldn't chaw,  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw.  
  
And the telling of his story,  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe.  
  
Now, I tried three times to quit him,  
But he did argue so  
I'm still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
And when I'm called up yonder  
And it's my time to go,  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

Yes, I been gamblin' so long,  
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.  
Right now I'm havin' trouble,  
Please don't take away my highway shoes.  
  
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,  
Or I'm bound to die tryin'.  
Yes, I'm a-bound to get lucky, baby,  
Lord, Lord I'm a-bound to die tryin'.  
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean  
And we'll leave this ol' highway behind.  
  
Well, the ocean took my baby,  
My baby stole my heart from me.  
Yes, the ocean took my baby,  
My baby took my heart from me.  
She packed it all up in a suitcase,  
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.  
  
So, I'm a-walkin' down your highway  
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.  
Yes, I'm a-walkin' down your highway  
Just as far as my eyes can see.  
From the Golden Gate Bridge  
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.

Bob Dylan,Dreamin' Of You,/b/bob+dylan/dreamin+of+you_20750947.html,"The light  
In this place  
Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
I'm expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
I'm hiding my faith  
In the rain  
I've been  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
They're ringing for  
Travel under any star  
You'll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
I'm sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
I've been dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe they'll get me  
Maybe they won't  
But whatever  
It won't be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Well  
I eat when I'm hungry  
Drink when I'm dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It won't matter as long  
As you're there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe you're here  
Or maybe you weren't  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane

Just like I did before.  
I tried to reach you honey,

Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore

I ain't gonna get lost in this current,  
I don't like playing cat and mouse.  
No gentleman likes making love to a servant.  
Especially when he's in his father's house.  
  
I never could guess your weight, baby,  
Never needed to call you my whore.  
I always thought you were straight, baby,

Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,  
The bottom of the barrel is too.  
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.  
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.  
  
Never no more do I wonder,  
Why you don't never play with me any more.  
At any moment you could go under,  
Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
You and me we had completeness,  
I give you all of what I could provide  
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,  
We were the wrong side.  
  
I've already ripped out the phones, honey.  
You can't walk the streets in a war.  
I can finish this alone, honey,  
You're driftin' too far from shore.

Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?  
Blowing through another no good town  
  
The lights on my native land are glowing  
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round  
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing  
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb

Blowing like she's blowing right on time

Bob Dylan,Early Morning Rain,/b/bob+dylan/early+morning+rain_20538910.html,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go  
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow  
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.

Drivin' the spikes in  
Blazin' the rails  
Nailed in their coffins

Fly away, little bird  
Fly away, flap your wings  
Fly by night  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
All the early Roman kings  
In the early, early morn  
Coming down the mountain  
Distributing the corn  
Speeding through the forest  
Racing down the track  
You try to get away  
They drag you back  
  
Tomorrow is Friday  
We'll see what it brings  
Everybody's talking  
'Bout the early Roman kings  
  
They're peddlers and they're meddlers  
They buy and they sell  
They destroyed your city  
They'll destroy you as well  
They're lecherous and treacherous  
Hell-bent for leather  
Each of 'em bigger  
Than all men put together  
  
Sluggers and muggers  
Wearing fancy gold rings  
All the women goin' crazy  
For the early Roman kings  
  
I can dress up your wounds  
With a blood-clotted rag  
I ain't afraid to make love  
To a bitch or a hag  
If you see me comin'  
And you're standing there  
Wave your handkerchief  
In the air  
  
I ain't dead yet  
My bell still rings  
I keep my fingers crossed  
Like them early Roman kings  
  
I can strip you of life  
Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
There'll be no one else  
That you'll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
I'm gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed 'em all off  
And they sent 'em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
You're coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court  
  
I've had my fun  
I've had my flings  
Gonna shake 'em all down  
Like the early Roman kings

Or on a frozen, rotted road  
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.

You're gonna walk that endless highway,  
Walk that high-way till you die.  
All you children goin' my way,  
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.

Well, I leave it far behind,  
Who knows what you're apt to find there.  
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',  
Well it look like t'me this time I wont be buyin'

When they get a scapegoat by the throat,  
it's hard labour and cold beans.

Bob Dylan,Eternal Circle,/b/bob+dylan/eternal+circle_20021266.html,"I sang the song slowly  
As she stood in the shadows  
She stepped to the light  
As my silver strings spun  
She called with her eyes  
To the tune I's a-playin'  
But the song it was long  
And I'd only begun  
  
Through a bullet of light  
Her face was reflectin'  
The fast fading words  
That rolled from my tongue  
With a long-distance look  
Her eyes was on fire  
But the song it was long  
And there was more to be sung.  
  
My eyes danced a circle  
Across her clear outline  
With her head tilted sideways  
She called me again  
As the tune drifted out  
She breathed hard through the echo  
But the song it was long  
And it was far to the end  
  
I glanced at my guitar  
And played it pretendin'  
That of all the eyes out there  
I could see none  
As her thoughts pounded hard  
Like the pierce of an arrow  
But the song it was long  
And it had to get done  
  
As the tune finally folded  
I laid down the guitar  
Then looked for the girl  
Who'd stayed for so long  
But her shadow was missin'  
For all of my searchin'  
So I picked up my guitar  
And began the next song

And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'

Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'  
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'  
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation  
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation  
And marches alone can't bring integration  
When human respect is disintegratin'  
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama  
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space  
But when your return, it's the same old place  
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace  
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace  
Hate your next-door-neighbor, but don't forget to say grace  
  
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Bob Dylan,Every Grain Of Sand,/b/bob+dylan/every+grain+of+sand_20021535.html,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  
When the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and the morals of despair  
  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  
  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

Things fall to pieces in my face  
  
Broken hands on broken ploughs,  
Broken treaties, broken vows,

People bending broken rules.  
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,  
Everything is broken.

Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea

And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in  
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from  
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back

Lost your power of recall  
Every little detail  
You don't remember at all  
The times we knew  
Who would remember better than you?  
  
Forgetful heart  
We laughed and had a good time, you and I  
It's been so long  
Now you're content to let the days go by  
When you were there  
You were the answer to my prayer  
  
Forgetful heart  
We loved with all the love that life can give  
What can I say?  
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more  
Why can't we love like we did before?  
  
Forgetful heart  
Like a walking shadow in my brain  
All night long  
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain  
The door has closed forevermore  
If indeed there ever was a door

Bob Dylan,Gates Of Eden,/b/bob+dylan/gates+of+eden_20021321.html,"Of war and peace the truth just twists  
Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
  
Relationships of ownership  
They whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly  
And wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs  
The lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

For a seventy-dollar robbery.  
Closed the door behind him  
And they threw away the key.  
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
He wouldn't take shit from no one  
He wouldn't bow down or kneel.  
Authorities, they hated him  
Because he was just too real.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Prison guards, they cursed him  
As they watched him from above  
But they were frightened of his power  
They were scared of his love.  
Lord, Lord,  
So they cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sometimes I think this whole world  
Is one big prison yard.  
Some of us are prisoners  
The rest of us are guards.

They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.

There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.  
There are frail forms fainting at the door.  
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
There's pale drooping maiden who foils her life away  
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.  
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.

Bob Dylan,Hard Times In New York Town,/b/bob+dylan/hard+times+in+new+york+town_20021271.html,"Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song.  
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.  
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell  
'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town,  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.  
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,  
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,  
Old mister empire never says a word.  
  
It's hard times from the country,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.  
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,  
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.  
Bought your city on a one-way track,  
If I had my way I'd sell it right back.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
I'll take all the smog in California  
'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,  
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.  
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
So all you newsy people, spreadin' the news around,  
You see'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.  
You see'n step on my name, you see'n try 'n' get me beat,  
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.  
  
Hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.

""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings  
And a thousand telephones that don't ring

Told the first father that things weren't right  
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""

And they were both out on Highway 61

Trying to create a next world war

With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.

And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,

I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.

But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""  
I'll say, ""It's easily done  
You just pick anyone  
An' pretend that you never have met""

Bob Dylan,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,/b/bob+dylan/i+dreamed+i+saw+st+augustine_10043230.html,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive as you or me  
Tearing through these quarters  
In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".  
  
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive with fiery breath  
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones  
That put him out to death  
Oh, I awoke in anger  
So alone and terrified  
I put my fingers against the glass  
And bowed my head and cried.

You think you know  
The smile on her lips  
The thrill an' the touch  
Of her fingertips  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You think you'll find  
A heaven of bliss  
In each caress  
In each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You stole her love from me one day  
You didn't care how it hurt me  
But you can never steal away  
Memories of what used to be  
You think she's yours  
To have and to hold  
Someday you'll learn  
When her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

Bob Dylan,I Pity The Poor Immigrant,/b/bob+dylan/i+pity+the+poor+immigrant_20021408.html,"I pity the poor immigrant  
Who wishes he would've stayed home,  
Who uses all his power to do evil  
But in the end is always left so alone.  
That man whom with his fingers cheats  
And who lies with ev'ry breath,  
Who passionately hates his life  
And likewise, fears his death.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Whose strength is spent in vain,  
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,  
Whose tears are like rain,  
Who eats but is not satisfied,  
Who hears but does not see,  
Who falls in love with wealth itself  
And turns his back on me.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Who tramples through the mud,  
Who fills his mouth with laughing  
And who builds his town with blood,  
Whose visions in the final end  
Must shatter like the glass.  
I pity the poor immigrant  
When his gladness comes to pass.

Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free,/b/bob+dylan/i+shall+be+free_20021595.html,"Well, I took me a woman late last night,  
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.  
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride  
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.  
(Right there  
Proud as can be)  
  
I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed  
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub.  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,  
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.  
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""  
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,  
Anita Ekberg,  
Sophia Loren.""  
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!  
  
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,  
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.  
Licks my face and tickles my ear,  
Bends me over and buys me beer.  
(She's a honeymooner  
A June crooner  
A spoon feeder  
And a natural leader)  
  
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,  
I got a woman who works on the levee.  
Pumping that water up to her neck,  
Every week she sends me a monthly check.  
She's a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thing-a-muh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week,  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!  
(I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,  
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.  
(He's eatin' bagels  
He's eatin' pizza  
He's eatin' chitlins  
He's eatin' bullshit!)  
  
Oh, set me down on a television floor,  
I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.  
She takes about fifteen baths a day,  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.  
(She's a little bit heavy!)  
  
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,  
It levels my head and eases my mind.  
I just walk along and stroll and sing,  
I see better days and I do better things.  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

It's just the same as talking to you.  
  
I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day  
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay  
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come  
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine  
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run

The streets in heaven are lined with gold  
I ask you how things could get much worse  
If the Russians happen to get up there first.  
Wowee! Pretty scary!  
  
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree  
I want ev'rybody to be free  
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater  
Move in next door and marry my daughter  
You must think I'm crazy!  
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.  
  
Well, I set my monkey on the log  
And ordered him to do the Dog  
He wagged his tail and shook his head  
And he went and did the Cat instead  
He's a weird monkey, very funky.  
  
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on  
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  
And my wig-hat was falling in my face  
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.  
  
I gotta woman, she's so mean  
She sticks my boots in the washing machine  
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude  
Puts bubblegum in my food  
She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""  
  
Now I gotta friend who spends his life  
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife  
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf  
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.  
I've got a million friends!  
  
Now they asked me to read a poem  
At the sorority sister's home  
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'  
I wound up with the Dean of Women  
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.  
Hope I don't blow it.  
  
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  
So I look like a walking mountain range  
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course.  
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.  
  
Now you're probably wondering by now  
Just what this song is all about  
What's probably got you baffled more  
Is what this thing here is for.  
It's nothing  
It's something I learned over in England.

From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say every man needs protection,  
They say every man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.

Crying out that he was framed.

Any day now, any day how,

She said she would always stay.  
But I was cruel,  
I treated her like a fool,  
I threw it all away.  
  
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,  
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.  
I must have been mad,  
I never knew what I had,  
Until I threw it all away.  
  
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,  
Love and only love, it can't be denied.  
No matter what you think about it  
You just won't be able to do without it.  
Take a tip from one who's tried.  
  
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,  
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,  
For one thing that's certain,  
You will surely be a-hurtin',  
If you throw it all away.

Bob Dylan,Idiot Wind,/b/bob+dylan/idiot+wind_20021193.html,"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press  
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.  
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.  
I can't help it if I'm lucky.  
  
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.  
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,  
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that  
Sweet lady.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,  
Blowing down the back roads headin' south.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.  
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,  
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin' every battle.  
  
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

Just do your thing, you'll be king,

It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,  
If dogs run free.

Bob Dylan,If Not For You,/b/bob+dylan/if+not+for+you_20021461.html,"If not for you,  
Babe, I couldn't find the door,  
Couldn't even see the floor,  
I'd be sad and blue,  
If not for you.  
  
If not for you,  
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,  
Wait for the mornin' light  
To shine in through,  
But it would not be new,  
If not for you.  
  
If not for you  
My sky would fall,  
Rain would gather too.  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,  
I'd be lost if not for you,  
And you know it's true.  
  
If not for you  
My sky would fall,  
Rain would gather too.  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,  
Oh! What would I do  
If not for you.  
  
If not for you,  
Winter would have no spring,  
Couldn't hear the robin sing,  
I just wouldn't have a clue,  
Anyway it wouldn't ring true,  
If not for you.

Bob Dylan,If You See Her Say Hello,/b/bob+dylan/if+you+see+her+say+hello_20021279.html,"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier  
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear  
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow  
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.  
  
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  
  
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free  
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay.  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off  
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  
  
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast  
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

Some people are very kind.  
But if I can save you any time,  
Come on, give it to me,  
I'll keep it with mine.  
  
I can't help it if you might think I am odd  
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are

Everybody will help you,  
Discover what you set out to find

Come on, give it to me,

But it'll be back tomorrow same time again.

Still stuck on the line.

Come on, give it to me,  
I'll keep it with mine.

Bob Dylan,I'll Remember You,/b/bob+dylan/ill+remember+you_20021362.html,"I'll remember you  
When I've forgotten all the rest  
You to me were true  
You to me were the best  
When there is no more  
You cut to the core  
Quicker than anyone I knew  
When I'm all alone  
In the great unknown  
I'll remember you.  
  
I'll remember you  
At the end of the trail  
I had so much left to do  
I had so little time to fail  
There's some people that  
You don't forget  
Even though you've only seen 'em  
One time or two  
When the roses fade  
And I'm in the shade  
I'll remember you.  
  
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?  
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?  
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you  
With the rain blowing in your hair.  
  
I'll remember you  
When the wind blows through the piny wood  
It was you who came right through  
It was you who understood  
Though I'd never say  
That I done it the way  
That you'd have liked me to  
In the end  
My dear sweet friend  
I'll remember you.

Bob Dylan,I'm Not There,/b/bob+dylan/im+not+there_20828002.html,"She came all rightoned and she's all too tight in my neighborhood  
She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone.

Bob Dylan,Is Your Love In Vain ?,/b/bob+dylan/is+your+love+in+vain_20021555.html,"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?  
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?  
I've been burned before and I know the score  
So you won't hear me complain.  
Will I be able to count on you  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?  
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?  
Do you know my world, do you know my kind  
Or must I explain?  
Will you let me be myself  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,  
I've been in and out of happiness.  
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings  
And I've never been too impressed.  
  
All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you  
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.  
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,  
Do you understand my pain?  
Are you willing to risk it all  
Or is your love in vain?

"
Bob Dylan,Isis,/b/bob+dylan/isis_20021333.html,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are comin' through  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense  
Take what you have gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home  
All your reindeer armies, are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Like distant thunder  
I had hope like a prayer unheard  
This nothing less than perfect  
In a less than perfect world  
  
All those angles running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting back together  
Hearts broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And it's a bad thing to let go  
It's a bad thing to let go  
It's a bad thing

And the way that you came every night

By the way that I feel  
So happy that you're here with me  
Some men that I've known have left me with nothing  
But I guess that was just meant to be  
Here I am  
I'm back on the street again  
Here I am

Hiding my face and got trying

Would you keep me safely

Waiting for their hearts to be broken

And your southern hospitality

I wanna lay next to you and be lazy  
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms

And I'm the man who won your wars.  
Is it over?  
Have you used me?  
I'm no value anymore?  
  
I'm your mothers,  
Wives, and daughters  
I'm your fathers, husbands, sons,  
I'm the life's blood of this country  
I'm the hopeful precious ones.  
  
Am I nothing,  
Am I no one?  
Once a fabric,  
Now a rag.  
We treat people like they're nothing  
We're not fit to fly,  
Fit to fly  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
We're not fit to fly,  
Fit to fly a flag (no, no, no)  
Join the Army,  
See the world  
The Marine Corps,  
Join the Navy  
We're not fit to fly  
Fit to fly the flag.

Cher,Flashback,/c/cher/flashback_20515132.html,"Flashback  
Writers jennifer hanson, jim patton-Johnson  
  
You were born between a rock and a hard place  
To a couple of losers  
I lived on the other side of your duplex  
I heard you getting those bruises  
I never would've wanted to walk in your shoes  
It scared me to death, I was a kid too  
Sometimes I think about you  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
Did you follow in your mama's footsteps  
Strung out on bad things  
Just a product of circumstances  
Never taught what love means  
Travis I hope you did it different this time  
All you had to do was make up your mind  
Well, how did you decide to live your life  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late now  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis  
And the circle goes round  
Until someone hears the sound  
Of a breaking heart  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if it's just too late  
Saw your pain, how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis

There's a man with a gun over there

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
There's battle lines being drawn  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong  
Young people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
What a field-day for the heat  
A thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say, hooray for our side  
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when you're always afraid  
You step out of line, the man come and take you away  
We better stop, hey, what's that sound

She had them in a trance  
Till some wise guy brought a safety pin  
Now she wears a grin

Don't be afraid cause it won't break down  
Dance and sing and raise your glass  
Drink to the good times and hope my friend  
That they last  
  
So if you're feeling blue  
It's really nothing new  
And here's a lesson  
You should take from me  
Because it's free  
Just you remember friend,  
To find that happy end  
To find a pot of gold  
Where rainbows shine  
You got to take the time

Long cue for the joker's shoe  
Ten rounds in the ring with love

Or win and lose  
Sweet rain, like mercy in the night

Caress my soul and set it right

Peak season in lonely town  
Knocked out of the ring by love  
Are you down and up  
  
Or up and down  
I ask the river for a sign  
(In a dream, we go on together)  
How long is love supposed to shine  
(In a dream, diamonds are forever  
But you and I, hurt together, hurt alone

Watching darkest turn to light  
Thinking back on all the things  
I said to him today  
Wondering if I might had a careless word to say  
When the morning's almost here  
He reaches out to draw me near  
Silently I search his face for the love  
I hope to see and once again  
I'm sure that all his love belongs to me

Finally descends on me

I gave you more than life itself  
So if you can walk away  
Love will come another day  
In a new disguise  
Maybe you're the kind of guy  
All you want to do is make me cry  
Sometimes I wonder why today

Where I was born, boy I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you  
He look so fine in Europe  
On all the posters and the brochures  
I thought they promised something more  
Than what was mine and yours  
Well I was looking for excitement  
On every boat and train  
But all I saw were unfamiliar faces in the rain  
Get me high, get me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of this pouring rain  
I'm tired of just passing through  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, babe I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you  
And now nothing look better in my mind  
Than your warm and loving face  
And all these miles have taught me  
That your loved can't be replaced  
Get me high, get me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of this pouring rain  
I'm tired of just passing through  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, babe I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you

When you thought that he would last  
When you weren't looking  
No you weren't listen  
And once he left you broke like glass  
Let this be a lesson to you  
Take this message to your heart

Thought you had yourself a true love  
Thought he was in love with you  
But he was just like a devil  
Took your heart and broke it to  
Well there's no telling who's on the level  
And there's no way to know what's real  
Just remember how it all happened  
And be sure that you know who's got the deal  
Let this be a lesson to you

Threw the bums a dime  
In your prime, didn't you?  
People'd call, say ""Beware doll  
You're bound to fall""  
You thought they were all kiddin' you  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody that was hangin' out  
Now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging  
For your next meal  
  
How does it feel, How does it feel  
To be without a home,  
With no direction known,  
Like a complete unknown,  
Like a rolling stone?  
  
You've gone to the finest school  
All right, Miss Lonely  
But you know you only used  
To get juiced in it  
And nobody has ever taught you  
How to live on the street  
And now you find out  
You're gonna have to get used to it  
You said you'd never compromise  
With the mystery tramp  
But now you realize  
He's not selling any alibis  
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes  
And ask him do you want to make a deal?  
  
How does it feel, How does it feel  
To be without a home,  
Like a complete unknown,  
With no direction home  
Like a complete unknown,  
Like a rolling stone?  
  
You never turned around to see  
The frowns on the jugglers and the clowns  
When they all come down  
And did tricks for you  
You never understood that it ain't no good  
You shouldn't let other people  
Get your kicks for you  
You used to ride on the chrome horse  
With your diplomat  
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat  
Ain't it hard when you discover that  
He really wasn't where it's at  
After he took from you everything  
He could steal  
  
How does it feel, How does it feel  
To be without a direction known,  
Without a home  
Like a complete unknown,  
Like a rolling stone?

Living inside our castle of loneliness  
Unable to make amends

In the madden crush  
Another day's gone dying in the dust  
  
Melody, listen for the phone  
While I change my clothes  
He knows by now I'm home  
Three days waiting took its toil  
This trying to type and crying  
It's getting old  
  
Melody, remember long summer days  
Playing grown ups in the city  
Mama saying sweet dreams sleepy heads  
Tuck in bed with you, my favorite dolly  
  
Oh Melody, with your raggedy charms  
I have looked for love in a stranger's arms  
Scared of going home, for what they'll see  
You know mama eyes could  
Always look right through  
And daddy, he wouldn't be so proud of me  
No, they won't understand like you, Melody

Cher,Mirror Image,/c/cher/mirror+image_20029709.html,"I get up this morning, forget about all my plans  
Think about my vacations with my latest man  
Everything I did, what I should've done  
Why I didn't stay why I didn't run  
Only I hold the key to unlock the door  
I might make mistakes I made them before  
Think I hear about my life as a book  
Think I rather forget but they forced me to look  
Chorus:  
(mirror image, mirror image)  
If it isn't in black and white  
(it never happened)  
(mirror image) reflection of me  
Do you see what they want you to see?  
Looking at my life through mirror image  
Mirror image  
Must I confess everything that I've done?  
Can't a girl go out and have herself some fun?  
I don't wanna be judge I don't want the blame  
Living for the day is how I play the game  
There always a dream there's always a stage  
Somebody's looking now it's on the front page  
Through my rear view mirror I can see where I've been  
I forget the beginning and I can't see the end  
Chorus  
Only I hold the key to unlock the door  
I might make mistakes I made them before  
Think I hear about my life as a book  
Think I rather forget but they forced me to look

To my idol the divine  
Hope this never happens to us

She may have a couple of gray hairs  
A little ragged a little haggard  
A few wrinkles here and there  
But you should of seen her 21 years ago  
She would of captivated you  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a stunting figure  
And her hips weren't any bigger  
Than her bust line  
She's gotten just a little saggy  
And her skin's a trifle baggy  
But there was a time  
When everything was perfectly place  
She had a beautiful face  
She may look a little made up  
Especially around the eyes  
A little groupie, a little droopy  
But once they were quit a prize  
Yes you should of seen her 21 years ago  
They were a devastating view  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a million men around her  
Giving gifts that would astound her  
Why she couldn't even walk down the street  
Yeah she had lovers by the dozen  
And she even had some cousins  
Who just couldn't stop  
Throwing themselves at her feet  
She was so dainty and sweet

Donna Summer,Cry Of A Waking Heart,/d/donna+summer/cry+of+a+waking+heart_20042314.html,"I stand before you with my mind open wide  
waiting to receive whatever will be  
the world the eyes survey is not the only world  
for deep within the soul can be found all things  
  
Like the shape of sound, the shape of wind  
like the shape of things when they first begin  
how could I stop what I had to start  
the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
All I want is to love you  
all I need is to get through  
what I believe is a light in the dark  
the crying of a waking heart  
  
You shine inside me like the moon in the stream  
and the waters flow around me  
  
Like the colour of sun I cannot explain  
behind the familiar the view is strange  
maybe to love is to fly apart  
and this emotion the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
(Bridge):  
Golden slumber  
now and forever  
truly rising  
imagine heaven  
one vibration  
this eternal thing  
  
(Chorus x2, out)

Whirl me round and round  
Dance me like an angel child  
He's passing through my world  
He doesn't even know  
Time's not on my side  
No word or goodbye, I'll go  
  
So dance on, right now I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
Just dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes, in my eyes  
  
Dance into my life  
Hold the moment fast  
Make believe in us  
Nothing real in life can last dance within my life  
Dance me to the door  
I can't see the time, but the time has come for sure  
  
So dance on, right now I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home

Just dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes, in my eyes  
  
Dance with me, dance with me  
Won't you dance with me  
Dance with me, dance with me  
Won't you dance with me  
  
So dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home

There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore  
Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance

To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes

Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover  
But he turned out to be like every other man I loved

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it  
  
Tell him to just get out,  
  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
Pack his raincoat show him out  
  
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:  
Enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough

Donna Summer,Eyes,/d/donna+summer/eyes_20042221.html,"Right outside the window something's happening  
A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
TV's on and someone's watching  
Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...

It's the voice of hope,  
It's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no one is in need.  
And there are no guns, no bombs and no diseases,  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
From a distance, we are instruments,  
Matching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope,  
Playing songs of peace,  
There is the song of every man.  
God is watching us, God is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance,  
Ohh God is watching us....... From a distance.  
From a distance, you look like my friend, even though we're at war.  
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend, what all this fighting is for?  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it's the heart of every man.  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it is the song of every man.

Down inside, don't get caught with foolish pride  
Blow the other things aside, its only you and me  
Believe in us, we were always meant to be  
Me for you and you for me, 'till eternity  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows I never want to leave you  
Heaven knows I only want to please you  
Don't you know love is what I need  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be

Donna Summer,Heaven's Just A Whisper Away,/d/donna+summer/heavens+just+a+whisper+away_20042318.html,"Watching raindrops, slowly falling  
Painting pictures on the window pane  
Feelings my heart cannot explain  
Oh the silence, sounds like music  
Seems like I can hear a melody  
Baby that's what you do to me  
  
(chorus):  
One thing I'm sure of  
Whether it's wrong or it's right  
I only want to be with you, tonight  
And if you want me to  
Baby ask me to stay  
Heaven's just a whisper away  
  
Feel the magic, taking over  
Please don't stop before we lose control  
Baby just let your feeling go  
Soft and tender, like the morning  
We get closer than we've ever been  
We're almost to the rainbow's end  
  
(chorus):  
I heard the winds of forever  
Calling out my name  
It's paradise, when I'm with you  
I will never be the same  
  
Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming  
'cause this time, this one is coming true  
So glad to share my dreams with you

Donna Summer,I Believe,/d/donna+summer/i+believe_10087790.html,"I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
I still remember how it used to be  
Seclusion in our love so deep  
A world to touch that meant so much to me  
And promises we couldn't hope to keep  
  
The cool romance and nights of ecstasy  
Slip slowly by on paper wings  
The cold reality of you and me  
Came creeping like a storm cloud gathering  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
The balance of our love hangs tenderly  
A careful step through broken glass, yeah  
One thoughtless word could kill a memory  
And days we loved together in the past  
  
I give and take i do my very best  
To keep this vision that i've seen  
I give respect if you could just accept  
There never really was a perfect me  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
You walk away and see yourself in retrospect  
Remember all of love's first visions  
Step aside try to see just what went wrong  
Living together isn't easy all the time  
  
I believe in you if you believe in me, oh  
There's still the chance that we can find romance, yeah  
I know we can  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'llstand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
I believe in you, if you believe in me  
I believe in you, i believe in you...

She was singing how Jesus saves

Looked to see what they could see

Them all down on their knees

With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
Now Jesus was a little lamb, his fleece  
Was white as snow  
And every where that Jesus went  
This lamb is sure to go

Donna Summer,I Love You,/d/donna+summer/i+love+you_10087851.html,"From my once upon a time album  
A song about two people who fell in love  
Showing up one day face to face  
  
Well he searched and searched for nights and days  
Till he found the one he loved  
And he wrapped her in his arms again  
And then he thanked the stars above  
That he found what he'd been looking for  
And he stared her in the eyes  
  
He said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
She stared him right back in the eyes  
With a look of disbelief  
Then she gazed off into somewhere else  
Was it real or just a dream?  
And she pulled him oh so close to her  
And she whispered in his ear  
  
She said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they really do  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they do  
  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
So if you find someone you love a lot  
You must never let them go  
You just hold them tight with all your might  
And you say three little words  
  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes I do  
You say ""I love you""

Desperate when you found me in time  
You saved me from the world  
Got my life back in control  
Chased away the madness in my mind  
You saved me right in time

And start to teach  
Show me how in old Milano  
Lovers hold each other tight  
But I want you sweet paesano  
It had better be tonight  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
""Fa subito!""

That was okay until you put your heart on ice  
Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye  
Hide away and left me lonely  
When I asked you why  
You wouldn't be precise  
Now it's my turn, start taking my advice  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Running down long back alleys  
Pouting like a spoiled child  
You've been acting so crazy, driving me wild  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that's just human nature  
I've done all I can, I can't seem to change you  
  
It's not the way that you love me

I've done all I can, but just can't change you

Donna Summer,La Vie En Rose,/d/donna+summer/la+vie+en+rose_20249324.html,"I thought that love was just a word  
Sung about in songs I heard  
Kisses could reveal that I was wrong  
And love was real  
Hold me close and hold me fast  
The magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see la vie en rose  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be  
La vie en rose

That's what they call her the lady of the night

And even less about the place  
From where she came  
  
Every evening when the night is close at hand  
You'll find the lady on the rue d'avignon  
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly  
It's just a job but she'll do the best she can

Donna Summer,Lamb Of God,/d/donna+summer/lamb+of+god_20042235.html,"[Spoken:]  
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea  
During the time of king Herod  
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked  
""where is the one who is born king of the Jews?  
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him""  
  
Lord we have traveled far  
Torn and weary guided by your star  
There before us the living king  
Hallelujah his praises sing  
  
Herod with a evil plan  
Kill the babies  
Came his bold command  
He tried to alter god's holy plan  
God has saved him  
The son of man  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
Three kings from a distance come  
Bearing gifts for the only one  
Shout to heaven sound the drum  
Tell the nations  
The lord has come  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
He came to bring us his peace  
He came to bring us his joy  
To bring us love  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The precious lamb of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god

And so the wise men the shepherds  
The ox and the lamb  
The angels above  
All rejoiced at god's command  
As a star shine from heaven  
This new king to adorn  
On that very first christmas  
When Jesus Christ was born

And on that marble wall which holds a million names

Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.

And I tried to turn away  
I was afraid to face  
What in-evil-it-able is  
Say you know the way  
To find true freedom  
Can you save yourself  
From the pain you're feeling  
Something in my head  
That you're dreaming  
That the angels said  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer

Set me free

Do you know the place of love

It'll do for you

But we're alone and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly but boy can't you see  
There's noone more important to me  
Baby can't you please see through me  
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I love you in a place we're there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody  
Cause my love's in there hiding  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine

They say that love comes only once  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once

God bless the child who's got his own yeah

Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Life can bring some tragedy sometimes  
So don't keep looking at the bad things  
Sometimes love can even blow your little mind  
Now I've seen it starting to happen  
You've gotta believe in the good things  
Believe in the good things  
You gotta believe that there's something that hold us in a sunny place  
You gotta believe that the sky won't fall  
Believe that's it's worth it all  
You gotta believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel  
And I know bad things sometimes happen for nothing  
But there's got to be reason we all found each other  
That we live and breathe and we need somebody else  
That's what I said  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Like a river running wild  
Like a river running wild  
I wanna walk down a down a country mile, oh baby  
No no nobody loves me  
No no nobody loves you  
The way I do  
No one can love you the way I do  
Nobody no no nobody baby

Trapped within their world  
  
Once upon a time  
Her hopes had died  
No one there to hear  
Her futile cries  
  
Living in a house of stone  
No one on her side  
Family in name alone  
No place left to hide

She'll awake  
To face the room around her  
It's just another lonely day,  
  
And bitterness surrounds her  
Bitterness surrounds her

It's just that I need to be with you  
  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
  
When I know our love is going strong  
And I have all I need to carry on  
And my mind and body seem to understand  
That for me you are the perfect man  
  
Our love, our love, our love  
Will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever

And make them behave

On sea or dry land

Miles along the shore  
And a thousand seagulls called on me

Underneath the purple sky

With the promises you keep  
They fill me with such happiness  
It makes my heart believe

But a prayer for someday better  
Is the one thing we all share  
Someday  
Someday soon

I hope that he turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may not be the man some girls think of  
As handsome to my heart  
He carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone who'll watch over me

I ain't the kind you can tie down

And each time I went reaching out  
That's when you let go  
Now don't try and pretend  
That you didn't know

If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Come on baby set me free

I couldn't stay for love  
I had to go

It's just because I'm meant to be  
I'm meant to be free

Broke my back, been split open so oft

Been knocked down, get up every single time

Gotta throw down, you gotta stand and fight

Donna Summer,Starting Over Again,/d/donna+summer/starting+over+again_20553440.html,"Mama moved out  
Daddy sold the house  
They split up the money  
And went on their way  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together again  
Starting Over Again  
Where should they begin  
'Cause they've never been out on their own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And the whole world cries  
He got an apartment  
She moved in with her sisters  
And he's scheming big deals with one of his friends  
While she sits at home  
Sortin' out pieces  
Of left over memories from thirty odd years  
Starting Over again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting Over Again  
Never any end  
What will the neighbours say  
(Just) talkin' talk it's small town news  
What will all the neighbours hear  
They just know they disappeared  
(They're) facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home  
And this far down the road  
You find yourself alone  
Two fools  
Starting Over Again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together  
Back together anymore.....

Donna Summer,The Way We Were,/d/donna+summer/the+way+we+were_20042306.html,"Spoken:  
Well you ladies out there  
You know what I'm  
I'm talkin' 'bout ya  
But you wanna know something?  
Did you ever try to remember or  
Or just place up a memory in your mind  
And it always seems so far away  
So hard to find  
  
Memories  
Light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-color memories  
Of the way we were  
  
Scattered pictures  
Of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another  
(oh yesterday) for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the change to do it all again  
  
Spoken:  
Tell me, how many of you would live your lives again  
I would too  
You girls?  
  
Memories  
May be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
And so it's the laughter  
We will remember  
Whenever we remember  
  
The way we were  
The way we were  
Whoaaahhhh

You don't have to tell me anything  
I can see everything in your eyes  
It's so easy with you

Just my desire breaking free

To unlock all the doors to the woman in me

Donna Summer,(Theme) Once Upon A Time (alternative),/d/donna+summer/theme+once+upon+a+time+alternative_20956681.html,"[Voice monologue over ""Once Upon A Time"" instrumental]  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'Cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

There's got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds I've never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothing's in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
I'm free  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've always must have known  
A lover of his own  
'Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
I'm strong enough to slay the dragon that's there  
I will live for love  
  
I've thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love

Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Where is he going  
How is he what is he gonna do  
Where is he going  
And what on earth will he be going through oh  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound

Donna Summer,To Turn The Stone,/d/donna+summer/to+turn+the+stone_20042275.html,"The moon retreats behind a silver cloud  
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Donna Summer,True Love Survives,/d/donna+summer/true+love+survives_20042276.html,"On big alley stands a lady waiting  
For awhile  
Acting out an untold story like a  
Wounded child  
But the mystery of the circumstance  
Won't hide  
She believes true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Waiting for her long lost lover  
Returning from the war  
Though I know she knew the truth  
She also knew much more  
And the answer that she gave to all of us  
Whispered low saying  
True love survives  
True love survives  
  
Is she dreaming does she know  
A secret I can't see  
Maybe there's a trace of truth  
In all that she believes  
  
For one day I took a look deep down inside  
A voice cried saying true love's alive  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
  
True is love is never-ending  
It's giving all and not pretending  
It's holding on although your heart  
Feels dead  
  
A quarter of a century of years  
Have gone by  
Still the dream of this peculiar  
Lady's kept alive  
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired  
A burning fire saying true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever  
Only love will last forever

Donna Summer,Virgin Mary (german Edition Track),/d/donna+summer/virgin+mary+german+edition+track_20553434.html,"Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes  
Looks way past 50 though she's barely 35  
Sleeps most days in the city park  
Every night down at Casey's bar  
And if she talks at all you hear her say  
""I was a lovely girl in my younger days""  
She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen  
But she dressed too gaudy for the likes of the people here  
Out every night living life to the full  
A string of men at her beck and call  
But smalltown people got smalltown ways  
And soon she was stuck with a brandnew name  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Lover of lovers  
How many others  
Your bed is never empty  
It must bring you plenty  
Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air  
The women were angry and the men felt like a share  
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town  
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground  
The first man there that had Mary laid  
Staggered back with shock on his face  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Be true to your name  
We've put you to shame  
You're not what we thought  
The victim of talk!  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Rumour was your ruin  
Evil talk was your undoing  
Heavy on the conscience  
Jealous talk and nonsense  
You were really like your name  
And we put you to shame  
You're not really what we thought  
Jealous talk and nonsense

It's the plight

Of the waves rushing out  
And the wind in the air  
It's the sight  
Of one longing to taste  
Of life

Echoing for more

Of a love unsung  
It's the pain  
Of just being young  
It's a cry  
Of a voice unheard  
Of a face  
Speaking silent words  
It's the hope  
That the time goes by  
Take you upon a wing  
Teach your soul to fly  
It's a wish  
That you'll live your experience life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call

Walking your path of life  
Embracing destiny one day at a time

The little lord Jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

I'd find someone there was no doubt  
But this time the feelin' is strange and different  
Since she's been gone there's one thing I found out

It takes a mighty man to live with lonesome  
Some big men might live with misery  
But there's one thing I know, for sure it's certain  
It's for sure it's gonna take a lot bigger man than me  
  
I've never suffered much in the hurtin' line  
I've always been as good as any man  
But show me who can lose in love and like it  
And I'll be the first to proudly shake his hand

George Strait,Blame It On Mexico,/g/george+strait/blame+it+on+mexico_20059596.html,"In a bar in Acuna called Ma Crosby's  
I found myself not feeling any pain  
I told a 'Frisco girl I'd come for freedom  
She said she'd only come to catch a train  
  
We struck up some idle conversation  
Traded all the troubles on our minds  
One thing led to another in the evening  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason  
That I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio  
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell  
I felt all the pains of a morning after  
And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime  
She took everything I ever wanted  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason

That says, I'm sorry, I know I was wrong  
I can't find the words that don't make it cheap  
It's right on the verge and just out of reach  
It must be a sad song with a blue melody  
And I'll bet you it's lonesome, as lonesome as can be  
But I'm starting to wonder if there's such a thing  
As a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Maybe tonight, maybe this time tomorrow  
Me and this guitar will get right with this sorrow  
And I'll play it for you, and you'll come back to me  
'Cause you were always a fool for the blue melodies  
  
So it must be a sad song in three quarter time  
That chills down to the bone when the steel guitars cry  
But if it's not the one that brings you home to me  
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Awe but if it's not the one that brings you back to me  
Then it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing  
  
Oh, it's just a sad song that's too sad to sing

A little fire was all it too  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed

You light a match an' your eyes adjust

I'll have everything I'll ever need  
Carrying your love with me  
  
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain  
Darling all I have to do is speak your name  
The clouds rollback and the waters part  
The sun starts shining in my heart for you  
You're right there in everything I do

George Strait,Check Yes Or No,/g/george+strait/check+yes+or+no_20059462.html,"It started way back in third grade  
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes  
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail  
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell  
Next day I chased her around the playground  
Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round  
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note  
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me do you want to be my friend  
And if you do  
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand  
If you want to  
I think this is how love goes  
Check yes or no  
  
Now we're grown up and she's my wife  
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes  
Not much has changed I still chase Emmylou  
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room  
Last night I took her out in a white limousine  
Twenty years together she still gets to me  
Can't believe it's been that long ago  
When we got started with just a little note

She has just one weakness I see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Most of the time I'm walking the line  
But sometimes I get out of hand  
My baby scolds me and later on she holds me  
She loves me and she understands  
She's perfection, she's a ten  
My baby never looks at other men  
She has just one weakness I see  
Her only bad habit is me  
  
Her only bad habit... is me

'Cause somebody done done me wrong  
Don't think for a minute  
That I'm gonna sit around and sing some old sad song  
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass  
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last  
  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
So bring on some sunshine, to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
When I am gone put it in stone, he left nothing behind'  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
  
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do  
But I like to do just what I like  
I'll take the chance, dance the dance  
It might be wrong but then again it might be right  
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings  
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything  
  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time  
So bring on the sunshine to hell with the red wine  
Pour me some moonshine  
  
When I'm gone put it in stone,  
""He left nothing behind""

I'm here for a good time  
I ain't here for a long time  
I'm here for a good time

Before I gave 'em my last name.  
Now my credit ratin's in the gutter,  
And the bottom line sure looks bad.

She and I, walked down a thousand times  
I just can't force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when I'd wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk, her talk, her smile lit up every room.  
They say things happen for a reason,  
But I can't find one good reason  
Why she's gone so soon.  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be.  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And we'd love the night away  
In that house across the bay.

Bailing hay outside Abilene

Before I hit the road  
She didn't come right out and say it

That shoulder sure was cold  
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course

Settled down in Dallas

Were the ones I spent with her

A time to give and to receive

It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for  
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it  
I'll never ask for anything more  
It shines, it's new  
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true  
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you  
  
We can build a little fire  
We can sit and talk for hours  
We'll just have fun  
You can tell me what you did  
Christmas morning as a kid  
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
I'm sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow  
To complete this singular wish  
It shines, it's new  
I know what I want and nothin' else will do  
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you

You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you  
  
You know someday's I'm tempted to run away and hide  
'Cause I can't miss the bad luck that's fallen from the sky  
I'm under some dark cloud, and there's only one way out  
  
I look at you, when the world is full of lies  
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you, when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you  
  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you

And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face

Please don't cry woman 'cause it's much too late for tears

George Strait,I Saw God Today,/g/george+strait/i+saw+god+today_20732125.html,"I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
She's a miracle  
I saw God today

But the fool in me came out one night  
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes  
And she changed the night I stepped across the line  
  
I should have watched that first step  
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind  
  
I watched her slip away a little more every day  
And my conscience couldn't live with all that pain  
She's growing colder since the day I told her  
And the love we had will never be the same

Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be

Tears rolling down her face  
As she packed away her memories  
In that old worn out suit case

I'd never open that door  
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more

There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me.  
She said I can't believe it cause I've never been in here  
And I've passed this so many times.  
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in
her eyes  
The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time.  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,  
Ain't it funny? Thats when love was found.  
She still calls it her lucky night,  
Yes someone was lucky she's right  
But it was me.  
It was me  
It was me

And never see me blue  
I just throw another log in the old wood stove  
And make sweet love to you

That I'm alive and you're the way you are

It wouldn't do a bit a good  
  
Pack and leave

And love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,  
And not an empty house where love just has been.  
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,  
Now love comes from the other side of town.  
  
The life I'm livin' now just don't seem right somehow,  
But it's the best way to get by that I've found.  
There's no love left at home, we're both just hangin' on,  
And love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Where love means just an hour with your stand in,  
And not an empty house where love just has been.  
Since everything we've built with love was not on solid ground,  
Now love comes from the other side of town.  
  
Love comes from the other side of town

George Strait,Love Is Everything,/g/george+strait/love+is+everything_21061484.html,"Love is everything  
It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring  
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing  
I've been told  
  
Love is everything  
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring  
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing  
And it's growing old  
  
Love is everything  
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm  
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born  
And it's a thunderstorm  
  
Love is everything  
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing  
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And it's you and me  
  
Love is everything  
It's looking out for everybody else but number one  
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings  
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings  
Yeah love's the king  
Love is everything  
Love is everything

Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.

Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style,  
But I lost that race by a good old country mile.

And she slips off her satin gown  
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise  
  
When we go out somewhere  
The men may stop and stare  
But they see she's a lady  
So they leave her alone  
She's more than she seems  
And in their wildest dreams  
They could never dream of what it's like to take her home

My mind comes across her memory  
And yesterday  
In Marina del Rey

On a hidden beach under a golden sun  
She spread a blanket that we laid down on  
And loved the world away  
In Marina del Rey  
And as we looked into each others' eyes  
We were lost in paradise  
Like two castaways  
In Marina del Rey  
  
Like the ocean tide's highs and lows  
Love sometimes comes and goes away  
In Marina del Rey  
And as this plane is touchin' down  
Tears touch my eyes for I have found  
My heart has stayed  
In Marina del Rey

Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still dancing with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
Meanwhile  
  
We move to the end of a beautiful night  
Tender the kisses, soft candle light  
She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs  
And reach for each other the passion begins  
We fall together as lovers and then,  
  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still lying with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
  
I try and I try, the Lord knows I do  
But each time my heart beats back to you  
  
Meanwhile I'll go on living my life now  
I'll find a way somehow  
Oh but, meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You'll always be with me

All alone in the middle of nowhere

My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Standin' at the edge of the sky  
On top of a mountain so tall  
Wishin' to God I could fly, fly, fly  
When I ain't even done climbin' the wall  
Could you help me let the teardrops roll  
Awe anything to cleanse my soul  
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare  
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere

They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.  
But someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.  
They got away with murder down on music row.  
  
The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame  
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang  
(oh, you tell them Alan).  
They all say not guilty, but the evidence will show  
That murder was committed down on music row.  
  
For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,  
But drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed up in your face.  
Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row.  
  
They thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone  
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still
buy'em)  
Well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold  
Murder's been committed down on music row.  
  
Oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles play  
With drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face  
Why, the Hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row  
Why, they even tell the Possum to pack up and go back home  
There's been an awful murder down on music row.

Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail  
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do you right overnight male  
  
I know your heart is fragile  
So I'll handle it with care  
There ain't no doubt  
I know love's route  
So baby let me take you there  
I'll bring you cards and flowers  
But I know just what you need  
Just give me 24 hours  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know your male's gonna get to you  
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail  
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male  
Yeah I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male

Gordon Lightfoot,14 Carat Gold,/g/gordon+lightfoot/14+carat+gold_20631271.html,"If you see me smile don't think I'm acting strange  
I got my just reward for all my pains  
I you see me on the TV talking proud  
Please understand if I don't talk too loud

Polish up the dice  
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll  
This is my advice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin' hot 'n' cold  
She's more than money  
She's 14 Karat Gold  
  
If you wonder why I'm acting up this way  
Gonna cash my chips I'm leavin' town today  
I got more love than I could ever spend  
So long, farewell, good-bye, this is the end  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice

Be as cool as ice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin' hot 'n' cold  
She's more than money  
She's 14 Karat Gold  
  
If you get hit by the bug that bit on me  
If you get caught with something soft and sweet  
If you get found with something you can't waste  
Then listen bud, let me give you a taste  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll

Gordon Lightfoot,A Message To The Wind,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+message+to+the+wind_20061694.html,"I saw a moonlit scene, I never will forget  
I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark  
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started  
What to my eyes appeared as dust  
Became a vision I don't know  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the day wore on I knew  
Another lonely night could never be  
If there's is a reason you might try and forget  
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?  
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land  
Whitecaps in profusion all around me  
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength  
To sail upon the raging sea  
If theres a reason for the way that life is  
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the days wore on I knew  
Another lonely night with you could never be  
I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real  
All that you can ever do when love is reveal  
Sometimes I every try why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?

Gordon Lightfoot,A Minor Ballad,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+minor+ballad_20061682.html,"Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee  
  
I have no gold to give her  
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue  
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her  
Into my heart so strong so true  
When will you love me  
As I love you  
  
Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee

Gordon Lightfoot,A Painter Passing Through,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+painter+passing+through_20061499.html,"Once upon a time I was on my own  
Once upon a time like you've never known  
Once upon a time I would be impressed  
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright  
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night  
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great  
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
I was in my stride, always at my game  
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame  
I was in demand, always in control  
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold  
Once upon a time, I was in a daze  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Now that I am old, let me rest a spell  
All that I am told, I can never tell  
Never in my life, never will it pass  
I am still alone, remembering at last  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history

Gordon Lightfoot,A Tree Too Weak To Stand,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+tree+too+weak+to+stand_20061520.html,"I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled  
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes  
  
The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand  
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands  
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be  
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free  
  
The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come  
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone  
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
  
I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

Gordon Lightfoot,Affair On 8Th Avenue,/g/gordon+lightfoot/affair+on+8th+avenue_20061509.html,"The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after she'd gone  
I remember it well  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  
Her long flowing hair came softly undone  
And it lay all around  
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side  
In the warmth of her love  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget  
Then left with the answer I've never found yet  
""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this  
Belong to someone?""  
""What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die  
We must almost be born""  
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide  
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide  
The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after she'd gone

Gordon Lightfoot,All I'm After,/g/gordon+lightfoot/all+im+after_20061630.html,"All I'm after is to be on your winning side  
All I need is to be turning back the tide  
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead  
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess  
  
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights  
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights  
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by  
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams  
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways  
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day  
  
All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo  
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through  
This is just a guess but I must confess  
It feels better being certain  
Please excuse my truthfulness  
What I'm seeing's worth believing  
When you thrill me like you do  
So you wonder why my feelings never fade  
I think I got it made  
  
In the evening when the rain begins to fall  
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all  
But you sound so sad, in your special way  
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day  
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways  
Ain't it funny how life changes every day

Gordon Lightfoot,Apology,/g/gordon+lightfoot/apology_20061661.html,"I remember everything  
I've learned about survival  
I've walked with fools and kings  
And I've even read the bible  
There I came upon some lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
Your kingdom is in heaven  
But I chose to live instead  
Inside the shell they gave me  
'til in spite of everything  
Good fortune came to find me  
I tried my best to run away  
But I could not avoid the feelin'  
Soon I was reelin' on my feet  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone and let myself surrender  
I didn't want to die at all  
I thought I'd live forever  
Then she gave me everything  
A king could never borrow  
But I twisted all her gifts  
Her wisdom was my sorrow  
So I left her cryin'  
And roamed across the river  
The angels offered me their hands  
But I could not forget her  
So I came to where she was  
By river, road and reason  
I slept beneath her window  
In the moonlight summer season  
But I could not go inside  
I heard the sound of laughter  
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow  
I didn't want to live no more  
Nor face the bright tomorrow  
Then I remembered everything  
I've learned about survival  
Havin' walked with fools and kings  
I've even read the bible  
I remember all those lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
It will not pass inspection  
And still I think when I'm alone  
Away from all night splendor  
If gold could buy one night with her  
I wish I had some to send her

You'll never be the same  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender

That life is not a game  
You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender  
You'll soon be on a one night tour  
Forgetting your own name  
You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender  
For the light so warm and pure  
Will draw you like a flame  
The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Like flowers in the rain  
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender  
With words you never spoke before  
And will not speak again  
Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly  
There is no way that I can see  
You living by yourself  
Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly  
Your presence means so much to me  
Much more that life itself  
Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear  
Please cast away the clothes you wear  
And give your love to me  
Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun  
I'd love to see you laugh and run  
As naked as the sea  
If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
Don't try and get the best of her  
She will not share the blame  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
There is no shame

Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way  
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you  
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane

To brown and to yellow they fade  
And then they have to die  
Trapped within the circle time parade  
Of changes  
  
Moments of magic will glow in the night  
All fears of the forest are gone  
For when the morning breaks  
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn  
Of changes  
  
Passions will part to a warm melody  
As fires will sometimes turn cold  
Like petals in the wind  
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls  
Of changes  
  
Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else  
One last cup of wine we will pour  
I'll kiss you one more time  
And leave you on the rolling river shore

Everybody's in step with the season  
  
A child is born to a welfare case  
Where the rats run around like they own the place  
The room is chilly, the building is old  
That's how it goes  
The doctor's found on his welfare round  
And he comes and he leaves on the double  
  
Deck The Halls was the song they played  
In the flat next door where they shout all day  
She tips her gin bottle back till it's gone  
The child is strong  
A week, a day, they will take it away  
For they know about all her bad habits  
  
Christmas dawns and the snow lets up  
And the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup  
She hides her face in her hands for a while  
Says look here child  
Your father's pride was his means to provide  
And he's servin' three years for that reason  
  
Rows of lights in a circle of steel  
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel  
High windows flickerin' down through the snow  
A time you know  
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round  
Everybody's in step with the season

Gordon Lightfoot,Cold Hands From New York,/g/gordon+lightfoot/cold+hands+from+new+york_20061511.html,"I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside  
But I was young and able  
When I came out the other end  
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble  
Unreadable  
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go  
I thanked him  
A face of white, a face of brown  
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger  
For a stranger  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me""  
I came down to live alone in New York  
The city of the living  
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men  
Were taking, none we giving  
Or forgiving  
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways  
I saw them  
There were men who lived in style and others who had died  
Where no one knew them  
Beause they couldn't win  
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms  
Where babies crept unwanted  
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope  
Or if it mattered what they did  
Or if they lived  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day

I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
And there were prophets in the squares  
And people there who smiled and said, ""Forget it""  
There were lovers in the park  
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it  
So afraid of it  
And there were preachers of the Word and poets  
Who were never heard, I heard them  
There were those who would not try to learn  
The measure of the lie they're livin'  
I heard a young musician play in a place  
Where they paid you not to listen  
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by  
And offered their best wishes  
That's how it is  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me

Gordon Lightfoot,Cotton Jenny,/g/gordon+lightfoot/cotton+jenny_20061642.html,"There's a house on a hill  
By a worn down weathered old mill  
In the valley below where the river winds  
There's no such thing as bad times  
And a soft southern flame  
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round  
  
When the new day begins  
I go down to the cotton gin  
And I make my time worth while to them  
Then I climb back up again  
And she waits by the door  
Oh Cotton Jenny I'm sore  
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round  
  
In the hot, sickly South  
When they say we'll shut my mouth  
I can never be free from the cotton grind  
But I know I got what's mine  
She's a soft southern flame  
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round

Cooooochiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching,  
Coooochiching  
  
Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands.  
Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands.  
To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing,  
You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
In Orillia they had movies, and sports and music too.  
And all around the shore line, were the folks that we all knew.

Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust.  
Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust.  
Any way you'd like to cut in, It'll hit you with a ping.  
When you think about Orillia, and it's by Lake Couchiching.

I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching.

Gordon Lightfoot,Crossroads,/g/gordon+lightfoot/crossroads_20061684.html,"When first I did appear upon this native soil  
All up and down this country at labor I did toil  
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun  
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run  
  
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea  
The people said Who are you and what would your name be  
I said I have no home and I am no man's son  
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
So I swung an axe as a timberjack  
And I worked the Quebec mines  
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines  
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town  
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds  
  
I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too  
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew  
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing  
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide  
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide  
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find  
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time  
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time

And talk about the home town a million miles away  
Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall  
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall  
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away  
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And looking at the rain, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Won't you say hello from someone, they'll be no need to explain

Gordon Lightfoot,Don Quixote,/g/gordon+lightfoot/don+quixote_20061548.html,"Through the woodland, through the valley

Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a battered book into his hand  
Standing like a prophet bold  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
I have come o'er moor and mountain  
Like the hawk upon the wing  
I was once a shining knight  
Who was the guardian of a king  
I have searched the whole world over  
Looking for a place to sleep  
I have seen the strong survive  
And I have seen the lean grown weak  
  
See the children of the earth  
Who wake to find the table bare  
See the gentry in the country  
Riding off to take the air  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a rusty sword into his hand  
Then striking up a knightly pose  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
See the jailor with his key  
Who locks away all trace of sin  
See the judge upon the bench  
Who tries the case as best he can  
See the wise and wicked ones  
Who feed upon life's sacred fire  
See the soldier with his gun  
Who must be dead to be admired  
  
See the man who tips the needle  
See the man who buys and sells  
See the man who puts the collar  
On the ones who dare not tell  
See the drunkard in the tavern  
Stemming gold to make ends meet  
See the youth in ghetto black  
Condemned to life upon the street  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand  
Then standing like a preacher now  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves  
He gallops off across the dusty plain  
In vain to search again  
Where no one will hear  
  
Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek

And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way

Sea of dreams I long for you  
Forget about the others  
This is my hike, you can come if you like  
To feel good, I would help you if I could  
But I am out here searching  
For the things that might have been  
I need no more reminders  
Not one love letter have I seen  
And that's a pretty good start  
The ocean is where lovers meet again  
Sea of dreams by all means  
Float me out of danger until then  
Forever amen  
It's a long, long hike  
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light  
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight  
The road is paved with moonbeams  
There are faces that I knew  
They all came back to haunt me  
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you  
It takes a bit of my heart  
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore  
Sea of dreams from now on  
Forget about all the others  
Back where the line forms  
Destination sea of storms  
By all means ever onward sea of dreams  
Put me somewhere east of midnight  
Along about daylight  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
If we could just lie down, love  
Toss some thoughts around  
It's a tough and a dirty long hike  
You can come if you like  
If we could just lie down  
Toss some thoughts around

Gordon Lightfoot,Ecstasy Made Easy,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ecstasy+made+easy_20061569.html,"I can always try to forget somehow  
What's a part of the past  
Have a little laughter if you please  
I won't even mind if it takes awhile  
I've got time on my hands  
I feel another chapter in the breeze  
And somebody touched my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody stole my heart away  
Nobody's sayin' their sorry  
It's a mighty sweet music  
You can dance all night  
Put some wood on the fire right now  
Ecstasy made easy  
Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name  
Or just another patron with a smile?  
Let me analyze you, are you a flame  
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?  
Somebody found my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody touched my heart last night  
Somebody set me in flight  
It's a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put flame on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy  
It's a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put some fire on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy, made easy  
I hope I never lose what belongs to me  
By the right of my birth  
At midnight sailing out of Perth  
Getting under way we turned westward bound  
On that southern sea  
To sea what ecstasy was worth

Gordon Lightfoot,Fading Away,/g/gordon+lightfoot/fading+away_20061717.html,"I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea  
In back of the eight ball in some misery  
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools  
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
They sailed right up to me, I said, ""What's it all about  
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out  
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real  
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel""  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam  
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
One more day on the calendar in my mind  
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time  
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way  
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
Fading away, fading away

What did ya do when the rain began to fall  
How did it feel when I looked through your soul  
When was the last time you wanted my love  
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep  
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden  
How could you put yourself through like you did  
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way  
Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad  
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you  
Where does it say love should last forever  
When was the last time I told that to you  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  
Farewell to annabel, farewell  
Farewell to annabel, fare thee well  
Farewell to annabel, farewell

Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste  
Gotta get away from here  
Twenty-one years from the day I was born  
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn  
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm  
You come to me  
You were the girls with the summer sunshine  
In your eyes and in your smile  
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me  
It was somethin' I never could quite believe  
Gotta get away from here  
I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am  
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram  
You can stick my money in an old tin can  
I think I fell in love again  
I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time  
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine  
I was almost gone, I was over the line  
I said what's come over me  
You were the girl with the sound of springtime  
In your songs and in your voice  
You were the one I thought, loved me  
It was somethin' I never could quite believe  
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you  
I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes  
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze  
Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes  
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you

Gordon Lightfoot,Heaven Help The Devil,/g/gordon+lightfoot/heaven+help+the+devil_20061633.html,"In this land of chance do we know right from wrong  
Even at a glance we know the road is long  
We don't owe a single thing to anyone  
  
Most of us do not believe in come what may  
Everything we fought for was in vain they say  
Even when called upon to throw our lives away  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
In these times of trial and uncertainty  
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me  
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy  
  
Our love for each other may not be explained  
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain  
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
To every unsung hero in the universe  
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth  
To all good men of reason may they never thirst  
  
We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea  
And faith that will remain through all eternity  
We try to be helpful to the ones in need

Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasant memories

Gordon Lightfoot,Home From The Forest,/g/gordon+lightfoot/home+from+the+forest_20061686.html,"Oh the neon lights were flashin'  
And the icy wind did blow  
The water seeped into his shoes  
And the drizzle turned to snow  
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead  
And the wine was runnin' low  
And the old man came home  
From the forest  
  
His tears fell on the sidewalk  
As he stumbled in the street  
A dozen faces stopped to stare  
But no one stopped to speak  
For his castle was a hallway  
And the bottle was his friend  
And the old man stumbled in  
From the forest  
  
Up a dark and dingy staircase  
The old man made his way  
His ragged coat around him  
As upon his cot he lay  
And he wondered how it happened  
That he ended up this way  
Getting lost like a fool  
In the forest  
  
And as he lay there sleeping  
A vision did appear  
Upon his mantle shining  
A face of one so dear  
Who had loved him in the springtime  
Of a long-forgotten year  
When the wildflowers did bloom  
In the forest  
  
She touched his grizzled fingers  
And she called him by his name  
And then he heard the joyful sound  
Of children at their games  
In an old house on a hillside  
In some forgotten town  
Where the river runs down  
From the forest  
  
With a mighty roar the big jets soar  
Above the canyon streets  
And the con men con but life goes on  
For the city never sleeps  
And to an old forgotten soldier  
The dawn will come no more  
For the old man has come home  
From the forest

I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips  
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives  
  
I've got a right to get it straight from you  
To give my life a different point of view  
To find a way to keep from losing you  
  
If you don't know what to say  
To understand is my life and the question is why  
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away  
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say

And if you need someone who loves you, why  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
  
I'll give you the keys to  
My flying machine if you'd like  
I will show you the light and when you call  
I'm gonna come to you  
And when you find someone who loves you,  
I'll know you would treat me the same  
Just lie there, you're not supposed to care  
  
I think you have somebody waiting  
Outside in the rain to take you away.  
That's some kind of a game  
Still I'm glad it came down  
To the final round  
But anyway  
  
If you think you need someone who needs you,  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care

Gordon Lightfoot,It's Worth Believin',/g/gordon+lightfoot/its+worth+believin_20061612.html,"There's a warm wind tonight

Where she goes, I don't know  
She won't tell me what it is  
Makes her act like this  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
Should I ask  
""Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea?""  
Or could it be someone kind?  
Could it be that I'm the fool?  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
There's a breeze from the shore  
And the waves overlap  
When I've called in the cat  
She'll go walkin'  
And she cries to herself  
In the night when I'm asleep  
She lies awake and weeps  
Could it be something new  
Some one old who has returned?  
Or is it just a game?  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'

Gordon Lightfoot,Love And Maple Syrup,/g/gordon+lightfoot/love+maple+syrup_20061644.html,"Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
If you go into the forest, gaze up through the leaves  
And see the sky that's almost wild  
You must learn to understand  
What makes the forest greet the man  
Like a mother's only child  
  
In the north when when winter's claw  
Relaxes now to keep the laws of nature in control  
People come and stand in line  
To rob the forest of her wine  
But they don't feel the cold  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
  
Love and maple syrup shine like  
Embers warm, like thoughts divine  
They tell us it is spring  
Love and maple syrup stir  
The thoughts of people into words  
Of songs that they can sing  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood

Must come to him who can pretend

That's where the line begins

There are times when I have told you  
That there must be two of us  
To try to work things out

And try to understand

To fan the flames would really be a sin

Pretending it is spring  
And you'll be mine again

And if you meet him you must be  
The victim of his minstrelsy  
He'll sing for you a song

There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
Think about the good things now and then

That we two had ever known  
We tried the handle of the house  
Upon the shore and found the open door  
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam  
Doing dances on the floor  
We were only playing like two children  
Who had stayed away from school  
Two of us could not be wrong  
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule  
  
I think this time we've learned enough  
To know that nothing is the same  
But still the pounding of my heart  
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange  
Here among my thoughts of you  
I find a gentle longing to be free  
There must be a way out of

Gordon Lightfoot,Ode To Big Blue,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ode+to+big+blue_20061550.html,"The oceans of the world were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best  
Was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam  
  
Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away  
In the mating of the day he was the king  
  
Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes  
And so he lived at sea a hundred years  
  
His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away  
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue  
  
Big Blue passed away to his natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way  
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand  
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue  
  
Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone  
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend  
And the killing never ends, it just goes on  
  
The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here  
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true?  
Only love would know, only love would do  
She lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain  
She says no, you say yes  
And that's how it should be I guess  
Only love would know  
May the light of love surround you tonight  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  
You think, you were wrong until  
You learned once and for all it's still  
One more lesson on the way  
Or that is what it seemed to say  
She's not the kind who would soon step down  
Not the kind you would try to walk around  
When only a thought would go very well  
You can tell by the touch  
Ah but only love would know  
Passion burnin' bright  
Tears of passion late at night  
Is the light of passion burning bright?  
Everywhere you go, only love would know

You go with me everywhere  
When I'm dreamin' you still share my lonely nights  
Try to see my side  
It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on  
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun  
And it leads me to the highways but it keeps my body warm  
  
And as I wander to the cities and the towns  
I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around  
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel  
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell  
  
Try to comprehend  
I'm not your ordinary friend at the end of my life  
I would pray that I could be  
Returning to the shelter of your love  
Try to see my side

That cling so desperately  
Must fly before the cold October winds  
Their simple lives have ended  
Must they be born to die again  
  
Oh may the light of freedom shine  
For all the world to see  
And peace and joy to all mankind  
Through all the years to be  
  
For soon the leaves will die  
And the long hard wind will blow  
May this world find a resting place  
Where the peaceful waters flow

On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame

To the sound of a thousand guns  
Who'd storm the gates of hell itself?  
To the tune of a single drum  
  
Where are the girls of the neighborhood bars?  
Whose loves were lost at sea?  
In the hills of France and on German soil  
From Saigon to Wounded Knee  
  
Who come from long lines of soldiers?  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol  
  
Where are the boys in their coats of blue?  
Who flew when their eyes were blind?  
Was God in town for the Roman games?  
Was he there when the deals were signed?  
  
Who are the kings in their coats of mail?  
Who road by the cross to die  
Did they all go down into worthiness?  
Is it wrong for a king to cry?  
And who are these ones who would have us now  
Whose presence in concealed  
Whose nature is revealed  
In a time bomb  
  
Last of all you old sea dogs  
Who travel after whale  
You'd storm the gates of hell itself  
For the taste of a mermaid's tail  
Who come from long lines of skippers  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol

Now you know this can't be true  
Even though the sun shines down upon you now  
Sometimes you must feel blue  
You make the best of each new day  
You try not to be sad  
Even though the sky falls down upon you  
Call it midnight, feelin' bad  
  
[Chorus: ]  
When you wake up to the promise  
Of your dream world comin' true  
With one less friend to call on  
Was it someone that I knew  
Away you will go sailin'  
In a race among the ruins  
If you plan to face tomorrow  
Do it soon  
  
The road to love is littered  
By the bones of other ones  
Who by the magic of the moment  
Were mysteriously undone  
You try to understand it  
But you never seem to find  
Any kind of freedom comin' clean  
Is just another state of mind  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
So take the best of all that's left  
You know this cannot last  
Even though your mother was you maker  
From her apron strings you pass  
Just think about the fool  
Who by his virtue can be found  
In a most unusual situation  
Playin' jester to the clown  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

For the children in her trust  
And of her grave concern  
For the likes of you and me and us  
Crying though she was  
She did speak these tender words  
The things that I am  
I could not change for any man  
I tried to comfort her  
Ah, but she would not be still  
And how the rain did fall  
As I found my way back down the Redwood Hill  
Crying though she was

Gordon Lightfoot,Restless,/g/gordon+lightfoot/restless_20061721.html,"There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within  
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin  
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry  
And I will always love that sound until the day I die  
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest  
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest  
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview  
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too  
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast  
Like an echo from the past  
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast  
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold  
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold  
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest  
We will be returning to the things that we love best  
Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad  
And the scrimshaw that he had  
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad  
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard  
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard  
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam  
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home  
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast  
Of a specter from the past  
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last  
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast  
See an image from the past  
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast

And maybe someday things will change  
And come with in range and be laughable  
Everything is okay

That's just a lie, they work miracles

Signs of a life without sorrow

Romantic like me when I'm with you

She lights the sun and conjures up the rain

I was chained to a wishing well  
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend  
Don't look now, she's right behind you  
Looking for someone to take her inside

She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you

To get on with a new tomorrow  
But I could never let yesterday go  
And when the falling rain makes me sad  
She comes to me in the dreams I've had  
In the morning light, in the dead of night

Is there something I can do?  
Take me out of the straits I'm in  
Let me show myself to you  
Somebody to whom I can belong  
Take my hand, I've been set free  
Give me some wings, I can glide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewings seams  
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams  
You know, living a life of ease  
Don't make yer meals taste better if you please

Gordon Lightfoot,Something Very Special,/g/gordon+lightfoot/something+very+special_20061541.html,"She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary  
  
She could be straight-laced or homespun  
Or free and easy on the run  
She could be meek and mild or full of fun  
  
She liked country lanes and aeroplanes  
And cigarettes would make her strange  
And when she wanted you she made it plain  
  
She would never say where she came from  
It didn't seem that she had anyone  
To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay  
  
She departed in the early spring  
She didn't leave me anything  
To follow or to find her  
  
She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary

Gordon Lightfoot,Sometimes I Wish,/g/gordon+lightfoot/sometimes+i+wish_20802150.html,"Dreaming of a love I lost, the day the final bridge was crossed  
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget  
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around  
Leaving me low and leaving me down  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart  
'Cause I can't keep us apart, forgiving you  
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned  
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
You're leaving right now

Gordon Lightfoot,Somewhere U.S.A.,/g/gordon+lightfoot/somewhere+usa_20960247.html,"Out on the road like a low-down Joe  
And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay  
Misunderstood like I knew I would be  
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
This rental car never went so far  
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
One never knows where the good times  
If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say  
I'd never lie, well you know I've tried  
Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A

Gordon Lightfoot,Stay Loose,/g/gordon+lightfoot/stay+loose_20061573.html,"If you've got a heartache  
Of the kind that will not pass by  
Even if you don't see the end  
Of what lies around the bend  
Don't stay that way  
It's all in a day believe me  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
How many times have I told you  
These are the tears I've shed  
Could it be that I need help  
Is it maybe I've come undone  
And one thing more  
You know it don't come easy  
Even the best of friends must part  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Soon the storm will be over  
And the clouds will all pass by  
To be insane beyond belief  
Is sometimes the best relief  
And one thing sure  
Love never did come easy  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away

Gordon Lightfoot,Steel Rail Blues,/g/gordon+lightfoot/steel+rail+blues_20061606.html,"Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her lovin' arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I bin out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I bin stood up I bin shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Well I bin up tight most every night  
Walkin' along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail  
Won't carry me home to the one I love

Gordon Lightfoot,Stone Cold Sober,/g/gordon+lightfoot/stone+cold+sober_20061712.html,"If you really knew how many times I've tried to help you  
Make your mind up in the matters of the heart, you'd not be bothered  
By the miscues or the bad trips that seem to come and plague us  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
I was stone cold sober, it was daylight in October  
When you reached across the table put your hand upon my shoulder  
And my lips were warm with kissing while we found the missing pieces  
To all the empty spaces I sure would like to talk that way again  
  
We have soared above the clouds, we've heard the angels breathing  
While we made love in the morning, there was never talk of leaving  
We would lie that way for hours with our arms around each other  
It was all so easy, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
'Cause I'm stone cold sober, the daylight has crossed over  
In the night, a touch of sadness  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I was stone cold sober when I woke the morning after  
Having shattered the illusions of the object of my passions  
With a will made out of iron and a mind that is her own  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to her again  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I hope that we can see each other often  
That our points of view will blend into each other,  
Like the sea and the horizon  
And the sun will shine upon us as we live our lives forever  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again

Gordon Lightfoot,Summertime Dream,/g/gordon+lightfoot/summertime+dream_20061657.html,"Where the road runs down but the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
In a lunch pail town in a one horse way  
You can live like a king and queen  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
On a trip on down to wonderland  
In love among the flowers  
Where time gets lost with no straw boss  
Tallyin' up the hours  
Where the road runs down by the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream

If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
  
She's bin lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream  
And she don't always say what she really means  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
  
I can picture every move that a man could make  
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sometimes I think it's a sin  
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again  
  
I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans  
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain

I heard you talking in your sleep  
Is there anything that I can do  
I don't believe we've had a word all day  
Bout anything at all  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
That's right, yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
It's a name I don't recall  
I heard you softly whisper  
I reached out to hold you near me  
Then from your lips there came that secret  
I was not supposed to know

I heard you talking in the night  
That's right, yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
It's a name I don't recall

Gordon Lightfoot,Thank You For The Promises,/g/gordon+lightfoot/thank+you+for+the+promises_20061638.html,"Thank you for the promises we make  
I know I can't complain  
I think I did all right  
No failures are in sight  
Only now and then  
I'd like to reminisce  
Do you remember when  
  
Even if we're angels we can't ask  
To wander through the past  
The future is our goal  
The night is black as coal  
If I could pay the price  
I'd like to love you once  
I'd love to love you twice  
  
Thanks  
We cannot say enough  
The road is sometimes rough  
But we can get along  
The going will get tough  
But we won't be afraid  
Of the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises you keep  
When I am fast asleep  
To be where we belong  
Is all that I can ask  
We can do it in the shade  
As long as I have you  
And the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises we break  
If you made a clean mistake  
Well that's what love's about  
No need to stand and shout  
The truth is in your eyes  
The answer lies within  
No need to criticize  
  
Thanks  
For the promises at hand  
The abuse that we must stand  
Is often heaven sent  
They may not pay the rent  
You never can be sure  
When promises get bent  
  
Thank you for the promises that live  
This is all that I can give  
Forever in my mind  
To leave the past behind  
And seal it with a kiss  
Forever in my soul  
I will remember this

Gordon Lightfoot,That Same Old Obsession,/g/gordon+lightfoot/that+same+old+obsession_20061617.html,"I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Early each day upon rising  
I think of my lost love from over the sea  
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air  
Peace in the sound of the river  
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold  
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul  
I long to return to the place I remember  
The taste of her lips close to mine  
I could do much better if I could be strong  
Come into my garden but leave me alone  
I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Just as the night comes stealing  
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name  
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart

To the night and the empty skies my love  
To the night and the empty skies  
  
The first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth turn in my hand  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command my love  
That was there at my command  
  
The first time ever I lay with you  
And felt your heart beat close to mine  
I thought our joy would fill the earth  
And would last 'till the end of time my love  
And would last 'till the end of time  
  
The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave

Gordon Lightfoot,The Gypsy,/g/gordon+lightfoot/the+gypsy_20061518.html,"Step inside my tent, said she, ""I'd like to read you palm""  
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long  
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind  
I'll tell you, if you should quit now or if you should go on  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake  
She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date  
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise  
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot  
You were told when you should speak and when you should not  
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night  
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake  
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said  
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get  
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
Where'll I go, what'll I be  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""
